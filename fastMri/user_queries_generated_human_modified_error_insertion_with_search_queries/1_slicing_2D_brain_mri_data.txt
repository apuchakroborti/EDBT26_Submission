The code starts by defining two constants: `FAST_MRI_BRAIN_H5_FILE` which is fastMRI_brain_200_dcm_to_h5.h5 (the path to the HDF5 file) which should be selected automatically based on the information below:
filter data based on the PatientID where the patient id is 8632676477

It then opens the HDF5 file in read mode, accessing the brain volume data by navigating to the specified path FAST_MRI_BRAIN_H5_FILE_DATA_PATH. 
It reads all data along all axes, storing it in the `brain_vol` variable.

The code prints information about the `brain_vol` data and visualizes a slice through different planes of the brain volume data using image plots. 
Specifically, it creates plots of bone map (a slice from 10 to 502 from both the rows and columns) , using indexing to select specific slices from the 2D array.
