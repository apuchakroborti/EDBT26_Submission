This program reads MRI brain data from an HDF5 file, prints information about the data, and visualizes it using Matplotlib.

Defining File Paths
Two file paths are defined: `FAST_MRI_BRAIN_H5_FILE` which reads data from the location fastMRI_brain_200_dcm_to_h5.h5 (the path to the HDF5 file) 
and `FAST_MRI_BRAIN_H5_FILE_DATA_PATH` (the path within the HDF5 file to a specific dataset) which should be selected automatically based on the information below:
filter data based on the PatientID where the patient id is 8632676477

Reading Data from HDF5 File
The program opens the HDF5 file in read-only mode. It accesses the dataset at the specified path and reads its contents into a NumPy array called `brain_slice`.

Printing Information about the Data
The program prints:
The data itself
The type of the `brain_slice` object (a NumPy array)
The shape of the `brain_slice` array (its dimensions)

Plotting the Data:
The program creates a figure with using Matplotlib. It displays the `brain_slice` data as an image, and applies a gray colormap to enhance feature visibility.
