Here's a rewritten version of the description with 20% less text while keeping implementation details:

I'm trying to understand some Python code, and I'd appreciate it if you could break it down for me.

The code starts by importing necessary libraries. Then, it defines two file paths: one for an HDF5 file containing MRI brain data, and another for a specific dataset within that file.

Next, the code reads data from the HDF5 file using h5py. It opens the file in read-only mode and assigns it to a variable. The code then reads two datasets from the file: a 2D slice of brain data called "brain_slice" located at "/brain_2d" within the HDF5 file, and a 3D volume of brain data called "brain_vol" located at "/brain_3d".

The code prints some information about these datasets, including their contents, type, and shape.

Then, it rotates a 2D slice of the brain volume by 270 degrees counter-clockwise using an image processing function. The rotated image is displayed with a bone-like grayscale color map and without axis labels or ticks.

Finally, the code repeats this process for a coronal plane (a 2D slice of the brain volume in the coronal direction).
