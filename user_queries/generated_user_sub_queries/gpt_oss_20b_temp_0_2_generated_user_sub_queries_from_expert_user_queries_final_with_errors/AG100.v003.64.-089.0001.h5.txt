"""
        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            A Python script that reads an HDF5 file containing ASTER GED data, extracts specific datasets, and visualizes them on a map.

1. Read the input HDF5 file in read-only mode.

2. Extract datasets:
   - 'Mean Emissivity for Band 10' from '/Emissivity/Mean' as a 2D slice (1st index along x-axis).
   - Retrieve the Description attribute's 0th value.
   - Set units to None and long name to 'Mean emissivity for Band 10'.

3. Extract geolocation data:
   - Latitude from 'Latitude'.
   - Longitude from 'Longitude'.

4. Process mean data:
   - Replace -9999 with NaN.
   - Scale by multiplying with 0.001.
   - Apply mask using numpy's masked_where.

5. Create an equidistant cylindrical projection map with Basemap, setting latitude (62.5-64.5) and longitude (89.5-87.5) ranges.

6. Add map features:
   - Coastlines with linewidth 0.5.
   - Parallels at 62, 63, 64 with left labels only
   - Meridians at -89, -88, -87 with bottom labels only

7. Plot data using pcolormesh with latlon=True.

8. Add colorbar labeled 'None' and a title combining the filename's base name with 'Mean Emissivity for Band 10'.

        Note: return only the the response of sub-queries only based on the below format, not explanation, not python code, and node additional text needed
        Return format:

        <generated sub-query>

        """

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
Open an HDF5 file with h5py in read-only mode, access the dataset at path '/Emissivity/Mean', read a 2‑D slice along the first index, retrieve the first element of the 'Description' attribute, and set the dataset attributes 'units' to None and 'long_name' to 'Mean emissivity for Band 10'.

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
Using NumPy, replace all -9999 values in an array with np.nan, multiply the array by 0.001, and apply a mask with np.ma.masked_where to mask the NaN values.

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
With Basemap, create an equidistant cylindrical projection covering latitudes 62.5–64.5 and longitudes 89.5–87.5, add coastlines (linewidth 0.5), draw parallels at 62, 63, 64 with left labels only, draw meridians at -89, -88, -87 with bottom labels only, plot the masked data using pcolormesh with latlon=True, add a colorbar labeled 'None', and set a title that combines the file’s base name with 'Mean Emissivity for Band 10'.
