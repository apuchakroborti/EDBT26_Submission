"""
        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            A Python script that processes an HDF5 file containing geospatial data. The script should follow these steps:

1. Define Constants: Set a constant `FILE_NAME` to the path "ATL11_051911_0321_006_06.h5".

2. Open and Read HDF5 File: 
Open the file in read mode and access the datasets `latitude`, `longitude`, and `h_corr` from `pt1`. 
Extract attributes `Units` and `long name` using decoding with 'ascii' and 'replace', and retrieve `_Fillvalue` from the h_corr dataset.

3. Data Preprocessing:
   - Convert h_corr data to float.
   - Replace `_Fillvalue` with numpy NaN.
   - Mask data where values are NaN.

4. Create Map Projection: Use an equidistant cylindrical projection with low resolution, setting latitude from -90 to 90 and longitude from -180 to 180.

5. Customize Map:
   - Add coastlines with a line width of 0.5.
   - Draw parallels at intervals of 30 degrees starting from -90 till 120.
   - Draw meridians every 45 degrees from -180 to 180.

6. Generate Scatter Plot: Create a scatter plot using longitude and latitude coordinates, 
   with data as the color variable. Use a marker size of 0.1, jet colormap, no edge colors, and no line widths.

7. Add Colorbar and Title:
   - Attach a colorbar below the map, labeled with the dataset's units.
   - Set the title to include the file basename, dataset path, and long_name from attributes.

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
How do I use h5py to open an HDF5 file, navigate to the dataset path `/pt1/h_corr`, read the datasets `latitude`, `longitude`, and `h_corr`, and extract the attributes `Units`, `long name`, and `_Fillvalue` from the `h_corr` dataset, decoding string attributes with 'ascii' and 'replace'?

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
What is the recommended approach to convert a NumPy array of `h_corr` data to float, replace a known `_FillValue` with `np.nan`, apply a mask to exclude `np.nan` values, and then compute statistics such as min and max on the masked data?

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
How can I create an equidistant cylindrical map projection using cartopy, add coastlines (linewidth 0.5), draw parallels every 30° from -90° to 120° and meridians every 45° from -180° to 180°, plot a scatter of longitude/latitude points colored by `h_corr` values with a jet colormap, place a colorbar below the map labeled with the dataset units, and set a title that includes the file basename, dataset path, and long_name attribute?
