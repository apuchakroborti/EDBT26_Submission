"""
        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            A Python script to read an HDF-EOS5 file and plot BrO data against pressure levels with the following specifications:

1. Read HDF-EOS5 File: 
   - Extract BrO data from the group `/HDFEOS/SWATHS/BrO/Data Fields`.
   - Retrieve pressure data from `/Geolocation Fields/Pressure`.
   - Obtain time data from `/Geolocation Fields/Time`.

2. Data Extraction:
   - Slice BrO data to get the 399th index along the x-axis and all data along the y-axis.
   - Convert BrO and pressure data into 1D arrays for plotting.

3. Attributes Handling: Extract attributes like MissingValue, _FillValue, Title, and Units.

4. Plotting:
   - Use matplotlib to plot BrO data (indices 12-16) against corresponding pressure values.
   - Set the x-axis label using BrO's title and units.
   - Set the y-axis label using pressure units.
   - Title the plot with BrO's title and the file's basename.

5. Plot Configuration:
   - Invert the y-axis.
   - Apply a logarithmic scale to the y-axis.
   - Use ScalarFormatter for minor ticks and FormatStrFormatter for major ticks.
   - At the end, the gca is set with invert_yaxis, yscale value of log, minor formatter is ScalarFormatter, and major formatter is FormatStrFormatter

        Note: return only the the response of sub-queries only based on the below format, not explanation, not python code, and node additional text needed
        Return format:

        HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:

        """

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
How to access datasets within an HDF5 file using `h5py`, specifically accessing data from groups like `/HDFEOS/SWATHS/BrO/Data Fields` and `/Geolocation Fields/Pressure`, and retrieving attributes such as `MissingValue`, `_FillValue`, `Title`, and `Units`.

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
How to handle `_FillValue` in NumPy arrays, apply masking using `np.ma.masked_where`, slice multi-dimensional NumPy arrays (e.g., extracting the 399th index along the x-axis), and convert multi-dimensional arrays into 1D arrays.

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
How to create a plot using `matplotlib`, set axis labels and titles, invert the y-axis, apply a logarithmic scale to the y-axis, and customize tick formatting using `ScalarFormatter` and `FormatStrFormatter`.
