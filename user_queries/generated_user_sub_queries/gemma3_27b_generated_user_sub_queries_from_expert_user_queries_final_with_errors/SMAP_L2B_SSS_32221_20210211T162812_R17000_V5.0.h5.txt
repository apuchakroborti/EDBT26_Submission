"""
        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            A Python script that performs the following tasks using the specified libraries and steps:

1. Import necessary Libraries

2. Read HDF5 File: Open the file 'SMAP_L2B_SSS_32221_20210211T162812_R17000_V5.0.h5' in read-only mode using h5py.

3. Extract Datasets and Attributes:
   - Extract datasets: '/lat', '/lon', and '/smap_spd'.
   - Retrieve attributes from 'smap_spd': units, long_name, and _FillValue.

4. Data Processing:
   - Replace _FillValue in 'smap_spd' with NaN.
   - Apply a mask using masked_where with parameters: isnan(smap_spd) and smap_spd itself.

5. Create Map Visualization:
   - Use Basemap to create an equidistant cylindrical projection map with low resolution ('l').
   - Draw coastlines with a line width of 0.5.
   - Set parallels from -180 to 91 with interval 45 and meridians from -180 to 180 with interval of 45

6. Plot Data:
   - Use scatter plot with longitude vs latitude, data from smap_spd, marker size 1, colormap 'jet', no edge colors or linewidths.

7. Enhance Visualization:
   - Add a colorbar labeled with the units of 'smap_spd'.
   - Set the title as the concatenation of the HDF5 file's basename and the long_name attribute from 'smap_spd'.

8. Save and Cleanup:
   - Save the plot as a PNG file.
   - Close the figure properly.

        Note: return only the the response of sub-queries only based on the below format, not explanation, not python code, and node additional text needed

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
How to open an HDF5 file using `h5py` in read-only mode, access datasets by path (e.g., '/lat', '/lon', '/smap_spd'), and retrieve attributes (e.g., 'units', 'long_name', '_FillValue') from a specific dataset within the HDF5 file.

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
How to replace a specific `_FillValue` within a NumPy array with NaN, and how to apply a mask to a NumPy array using `np.ma.masked_where` based on a condition (e.g., `np.isnan`).

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
How to create an equidistant cylindrical map projection using `mpl_toolkits.basemap` with a specified resolution, draw coastlines with a specific line width, set parallels and meridians with specified ranges and intervals, create a scatter plot with longitude and latitude data, apply a colormap, remove edge colors and linewidths, add a colorbar with a label, and set the plot title.
