"""
        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            A Python program to access and visualize radiometer data from a SMAP L1A HDF5 file. 
The program should import necessary libraries such as os, datetime, h5py, numpy, matplotlib, and Basemap.

The program defines a function `run` that takes a filename as input. This function reads the specified HDF5 file and extracts datasets:
- `moments16_right_ascension`
- `moments16_lat` (latitude data)
- `moments16_lon` (longitude data)
from the group `HighResolution_Moments_Data`

It retrieves attributes from the `moments16_right_ascension` dataset, including units, long_name, _FillValue, valid_max, and valid_min.

The program calculates invalid data using logical comparisons for values exceeding valid ranges and matching fill values. 
It sets invalid data points to NaN and creates a masked array.

For visualization, it initializes a Basemap with cylindrical projection, 
    sets up the map boundaries such latitude values from -90 to 90 and longitude values from -180 to 180,
    adds coastlines, draws parallels and meridians with specific labels, 
    and plots the data as a scatter plot with a jet colormap.

Finally, it adds a colorbar with a label derived from the dataset's long_name attribute.

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
How to use h5py to access datasets like `moments16_right_ascension`, `moments16_lat`, and `moments16_lon` from the group `HighResolution_Moments_Data` in a SMAP L1A HDF5 file, and retrieve attributes such as units, long_name, _FillValue, valid_max, and valid_min.

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
How to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and calculate invalid data points by comparing values against valid ranges (valid_max, valid_min) in a dataset from an HDF5 file.

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
How to use matplotlib and Basemap to initialize a cylindrical projection map, set latitude/longitude boundaries (-90 to 90, -180 to 180), add coastlines, draw parallels and meridians with labels, create scatter plots with jet colormap, and add colorbars with custom labels.
