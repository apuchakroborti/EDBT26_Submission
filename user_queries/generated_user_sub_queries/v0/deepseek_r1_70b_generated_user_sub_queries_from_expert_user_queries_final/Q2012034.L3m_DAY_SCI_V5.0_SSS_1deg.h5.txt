        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
        - Import necessary libraries: os, datetime, h5py, numpy as np, matplotlib as mpl, matplotlib.pyplot as plt, and mpl_toolkits.basemap.Basemap.

- Define variables for file handling and data storage, including FILE_NAME for the HDF5 file path.

- Read the HDF5 file using h5py, extracting the 'l3m_data' dataset into a variable named datavar.

- Retrieve attributes from l3m_data: data_minimum, data_maximum, and _FillValue.

- Replace _FillValue in l3m_data with NaN values.

- Create invalid_data by identifying values outside the range [data_minimum, data_maximum] using logical OR operations.

- Set metadata variables: units = 'psu' and long_name = 'Sea Surface Salinity'.

- Compare data against valid ranges and set out-of-range values to NaN.

- Initialize a Basemap instance with cylindrical projection, setting resolution to 'l', latitude limits from -90 to 90, and longitude limits from -180 to 180.

- Generate x and y coordinates using meshgrid based on longitude and latitude arrays.

- Add geographical features: coastlines with linewidth 0.5, parallels at intervals of 45 degrees, and meridians at intervals of 45 degrees with specific labels.

- Create a scatter plot of the data using the 'jet' colormap.

- Append a colorbar to the plot with units labeled as 'psu'.

- Set the plot title using the filename and long_name attributes.

Okay, so I'm trying to help the user break down their data science task into three specific sub-queries. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, looking at the HDF5 Dataset Access section. The user wants to access an HDF5 file using h5py and extract a dataset called 'l3m_data'. They also need to retrieve attributes like data_minimum, data_maximum, and _FillValue. So I should focus on how to open the file with h5py, navigate to the correct path, and pull out both the dataset and its associated metadata.

Next, for NumPy-based Data Preprocessing. The user has to handle the _FillValue by replacing it with NaNs. Then they need to identify invalid data points that fall outside the min and max range using logical operations. I should think about how to use np.where or masked arrays to apply these masks effectively. Also, ensuring that after masking, the data is properly updated.

Lastly, the Map Plotting and Visualization part. They're using Basemap to create a cylindrical projection map. I need to figure out how to set up the map with the correct resolution and boundaries. Then, generating coordinates from longitude and latitude arrays, adding coastlines, parallels, meridians, and creating a scatter plot with a jet colormap. Finally, adding a colorbar and setting the title based on metadata.

I should make sure each sub-query is concise and targets only the specific technical domain without mixing them up.
