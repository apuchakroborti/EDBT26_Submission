        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
        1. File Input and Constants
   - Specify the input file `MOP02N-20180311-L2V19.9.2.he5` stored in the constant `FILE_NAME`.
   - Import necessary libraries: `os`, `datetime`, `h5py`, `numpy` as `np`, `matplotlib` as `mpl`, `matplotlib.pyplot` as `plt`, and `mpl_toolkits.basemap.Basemap`.

2. Extracting Data
   - Extract data from the HDF5 dataset at `/HDFEOS/SWATHS/MOP02/Data Fields/RetrievedCOTotalColumn`.
   - Read the contents into an array called `data`, taking only the first column.
   - Retrieve the `units` and `_FillValue` attributes associated with this dataset.
   - Replace the `_FillValue` in the `RetrievedCOTotalColumn` data with `numpy.nan`.

3. Extracting Geolocation Data
   - Extract latitude values from `/HDFEOS/SWATHS/MOP02/Geolocation Fields/Latitude`.
   - Extract longitude values from `/HDFEOS/SWATHS/MOP02/Geolocation Fields/Longitude`.

4. Creating a Map
   - Add coastlines with a line width of 0.5.
   - Draw parallels using `numpy.arange(-90, 91, 45)`.
   - Draw meridians using `numpy.arange(-180, 181, 45)` and set labels to `[True, False, False, True]`.

5. Scatter Plot
   - Create a scatter plot with parameters: longitude, latitude, data array `c=data`, marker size `s=1`, colormap `plt.cm.jet`, no edge colors (`edgecolors=None`), and line width `linewidth=0`.

6. Customizing the Map
   - Add a colorbar to represent the units of the data.
   - Set the colorbar label using the `units` attribute from the dataset.

        Note: return only the the response of sub-queries only based on the below format, not explanation, not python code, and node additional text needed
        Return format:

Okay, so I'm trying to break down this user's query into three focused sub-queries. Let me start by understanding what each part of their original query is asking for.

First, the user has a section about file input and constants. They specify an HE5 file named MOP02N-20180311-L2V19.9.2.he5 stored in FILE_NAME. They also list several libraries to import: os, datetime, h5py, numpy as np, matplotlib as mpl, matplotlib.pyplot as plt, and Basemap from mpl_toolkits.

Next, they want to extract data from an HDF5 dataset at a specific path. They mention reading only the first column into an array called 'data'. Also, they need to retrieve units and _FillValue attributes and replace _FillValue with NaN in the data.

Then, extracting geolocation data: latitude and longitude from their respective paths in the HDF5 file.

For creating the map, they specify adding coastlines with a line width of 0.5, drawing parallels every 45 degrees using numpy.arange, same for meridians but with specific labels.

The scatter plot requires parameters like longitude, latitude, data array 'c=data', marker size 1, colormap jet, no edge colors, and linewidth 0.

Finally, customizing the map by adding a colorbar representing the units from the dataset and setting the label using the units attribute.

Now, I need to split this into three sub-queries. 

The first should focus on HDF5 access: opening the file with h5py, accessing datasets at specific paths, handling attributes like _FillValue and units. So, the sub-query would include how to open the HE5 file, read data from the specified path, extract attributes, and replace fill values.

Second, NumPy preprocessing: handling _FillValue by replacing it with NaN, applying masks using np.where or masked_where, and any other preprocessing like min/max. The sub-query should cover these steps specifically with NumPy functions.

Third, plotting with Basemap or Cartopy: setting up the map with coastlines, parallels, meridians, creating a scatter plot with given parameters, adding colorbars, and labels. This would involve using matplotlib and Basemap for visualization.

I need to ensure each sub-query is concise and targets only its specific domain without overlapping. So, I'll structure them clearly under each category.

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:  
How to access the HDF5 dataset at `/HDFEOS/SWATHS/MOP02/Data Fields/RetrievedCOTotalColumn` using `h5py`, read the first column into an array called `data`, and retrieve the `units` and `_FillValue` attributes.

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:  
How to replace the `_FillValue` in the `RetrievedCOTotalColumn` data with `numpy.nan` using NumPy functions like `np.where` or `np.ma.masked_where`.

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:  
How to create a scatter plot using longitude and latitude coordinates, with parameters such as marker size `s=1`, colormap `plt.cm.jet`, no edge colors (`edgecolors=None`), and linewidth `linewidth=0`, and add a colorbar with the label from the dataset's `units` attribute.
