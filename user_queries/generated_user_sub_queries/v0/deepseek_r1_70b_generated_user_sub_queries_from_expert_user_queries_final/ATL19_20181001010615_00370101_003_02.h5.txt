        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
        1. Import Libraries: Import necessary libraries including os, matplotlib, matplotlib.pyplot, numpy, and mpl_toolkits.basemap for handling OS functions, plotting, numerical operations, map projections, and HDF5 files.

2. Define Constants: Set the constant `FILE_NAME` to "ATL19_20181001010615_00370101_003_02.h5".

3. Read HDF5 File: Open the HDF5 file in read mode and access datasets at paths `/mid_latitude/latitude`, `/mid_latitude/longitude`, and `/mid_latitude/beam_1/dot_avg`.

4. Extract Attributes: For each dataset, read attributes `units` and `long_name` using decode('ascii', 'replace') and retrieve `_FillValue` from the main data.

5. Data Processing:
   - Convert main data to float type.
   - Replace `_FillValue` with numpy NaN.
   - Mask data where values are NaN using numpy masked_where.

6. Create Map: Initialize a cylindrical projection map with low resolution, setting latitude and longitude ranges from -90 to 90 and -180 to 180 respectively.

7. Add Map Features:
   - Draw coastlines with a line width of 0.5.
   - Add parallels at latitudes [-90, 30, 60] and meridians at longitudes [-180, -45, 45, 180].

8. Adjust Longitude: Subtract 180 degrees from longitude values before plotting.

9. Plot Data: Use pcolormesh to plot the data with parameters including longitude, latitude, data array, and latlon=True.

10. Add Colorbar and Title:
    - Attach a colorbar at the bottom of the map, labeled with the dataset's units.
    - Set the title using the file basename and `long_name` attribute from the main dataset.

        Note: return only the the response of sub-queries only based on the below format, not explanation, not python code, and node additional text needed

Okay, so I need to break down this user's query into three specific sub-queries. Let me start by understanding what each part of their task involves.

First, the user is working with HDF5 files using h5py. They want to access datasets at specific paths like '/mid_latitude/latitude' and read attributes such as 'units' and 'long_name'. Also, they need to retrieve the _FillValue from the main data. So for the first sub-query, I should focus on how to use h5py to open the file, navigate to these datasets, access their data and attributes, and handle the _FillValue.

Next, the preprocessing part involves converting data to float, replacing _FillValue with NaNs, and masking where values are NaN. They mentioned using numpy functions like np.where or np.ma.masked_where. So the second sub-query should cover these steps, ensuring that the data is properly cleaned and prepared for visualization.

Lastly, the plotting section uses matplotlib and basemap to create a map. They need a cylindrical projection with specific latitude and longitude ranges. Features like coastlines, parallels, and meridians are to be added. The data is plotted using pcolormesh, and a colorbar and title are included. So the third sub-query should focus on setting up the map correctly, adding all these elements, and plotting the data with appropriate parameters.

I need to make sure each sub-query is concise and targets only the specific technical domain without overlapping. That way, the user can find relevant documentation or examples easily.
