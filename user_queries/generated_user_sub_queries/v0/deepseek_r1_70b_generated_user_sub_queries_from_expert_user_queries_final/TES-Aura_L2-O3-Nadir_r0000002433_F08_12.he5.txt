        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
        Create a Python script to visualize ozone (O3) data from an HDF5 file with the following specifications:

1. Import Libraries: Include os, h5py, numpy as np, matplotlib as mpl, matplotlib.pyplot as plt, and Basemap from mpl_toolkits.basemap.

2. Load Data:
   - Open the HDF5 file: 'TES-Aura_L2-O3-Nadir_r0000002433_F08_12.he5'.
   - Extract ozone data from '/HDFEOS/SWATHS/O3NadirSwath/Data Fields/O3' (all rows, 6th column).
   - Retrieve latitude and longitude from their respective paths.

3. Data Processing:
   - Extract Units, Title, and FillValue attributes from the O3 dataset.
   - Replace FillValues with NaNs in the ozone data.

4. Create Map:
   - Use Basemap with cylindrical projection, low resolution, lat limits [-90, 90], lon limits [-180, 180].
   - Draw coastlines (linewidth=0.5), parallels (every 45 degrees), and meridians (every 45 degrees with labels on left and right).

5. Plot Data:
   - Scatter plot ozone data using longitude, latitude coordinates; set marker size to 1.

6. Customize Plot:
   - Add colorbar labeled with O3 Units.
   - Set title combining HDF5 filename base and O3 long_name attribute.

Okay, so I need to break down this user query into three specific sub-queries. Let me start by understanding what the user is asking for.

The main task is to create a Python script that visualizes ozone data from an HDF5 file. The user has provided detailed steps, so my job is to split this into three focused areas: accessing the HDF5 dataset, preprocessing the data with NumPy, and plotting using mapping tools.

First, looking at the HDF5 part. The user wants to open a specific HE5 file and extract ozone data from a particular path. They also need to get latitude and longitude from their respective paths. So I should frame this as a sub-query that focuses on h5py operations, accessing datasets by path, and handling attributes.

Next, the data processing step involves extracting attributes like units, title, and fill value. Then replacing fill values with NaNs using NumPy functions. This is clearly about data manipulation, so the sub-query should focus on using NumPy for masking and replacing values based on these attributes.

Lastly, the visualization part uses Basemap to create a map with specific projections and overlays. The user wants coastlines, parallels, meridians, and a scatter plot of ozone data. So this sub-query needs to target how to set up the map and plot the data points correctly.

I need to make sure each sub-query is concise and only covers its specific domain without overlapping into others. That way, when someone looks them up in a vector database, they can find relevant examples or documentation easily.
