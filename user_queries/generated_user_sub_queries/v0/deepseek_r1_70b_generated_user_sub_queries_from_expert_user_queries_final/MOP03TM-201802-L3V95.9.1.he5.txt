        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
        Create a Python script that performs the following tasks:

1. Import Libraries: Import the required libraries, including `os`, `datetime`, `h5py`, `numpy` as `np`, `matplotlib` as `mpl`, `matplotlib.pyplot` as `plt`, and `Basemap` from `mpl_toolkits.basemap`.

2. Read HDF-EOS File: Open and read the HDF-EOS file named `MOP03TM-201802-L3V95.9.1.he5`.

3. Access Datasets:
   - Read the dataset located at `/HDFEOS/GRIDS/MOP03/Data Fields/RetrievedSurfaceTemperatureDay` into a variable named `data`.
   - Extract attributes from this dataset, including `long_name`, `units`, and `_FillValue`. Decode string attributes using the `decode()` method.

4. Data Preprocessing:
   - Replace values in the `RetrievedSurfaceTemperatureDay` dataset that match `_FillValue` with `NaN`.
   - Create a masked array using `numpy.ma.masked_array` to mask invalid or missing data points identified by `numpy.isnan`.

5. Retrieve Geolocation Information:
   - Extract latitude and longitude datasets from `/HDFEOS/GRIDS/MOP03/Data Fields/Latitude` and `/HDFEOS/GRIDS/MOP03/Data Fields/Longitude`, respectively, into variables named `x` (latitude) and `y` (longitude).
   - Generate a 2D meshgrid using `numpy.meshgrid` from the latitude and longitude data.

6. Create Basemap:
   - Set up a cylindrical projection map with low resolution.
   - Define the map boundaries with latitude ranging from -90 to 90 and longitude from -180 to 180.
   - Add coastlines with a line width of 0.5.
   - Draw parallels using `numpy.arange` with values at -90, 0, 45, 60, 75, 90 and meridians using `numpy.arange` with values at -180, -135, -90, -45, 0, 45, 90, 135, 180. Set labels for these meridians as `[True, False, False, True]`.
   - Use `pcolormesh` to plot the data on the map, ensuring `latlon=True`.

7. Visualize Data:
   - Add a colorbar to the plot.
   - Label the colorbar using the `units` attribute from the dataset.

This structured approach ensures that each step is clear and technically accurate for code generation by LLMs.

Okay, so I need to break down this user's query into three specific sub-queries. Let me start by understanding what each part of the user's request entails.

First, the user wants a Python script that does several things with HDF-EOS files and visualization. They've outlined seven steps, from importing libraries to visualizing data. My task is to split this into three focused areas: HDF5 access, NumPy preprocessing, and map plotting.

Looking at step 2 and part of step 3, the user is dealing with reading an HDF5 file using h5py. They need to open the specific HE5 file and access datasets like 'RetrievedSurfaceTemperatureDay'. Also, extracting attributes such as long_name, units, and _FillValue is important here.

Next, for data preprocessing in steps 4 and part of 3, the user wants to replace _FillValue with NaNs. They also need to create a masked array using NumPy functions like np.where or np.ma.masked_where. Handling missing data and applying masks falls under this category.

Then, steps 5, 6, and 7 are about geolocation and visualization. Extracting latitude and longitude, creating a meshgrid with NumPy, setting up a Basemap with specific projections and boundaries, adding coastlines and grid lines, and plotting the data using pcolormesh. Also, adding a colorbar and labels is part of this.

I need to make sure each sub-query is concise and targets only the specified technical domains. So, I'll structure them separately without overlapping.

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:  
How do I use `h5py` to open an HDF-EOS file named `MOP03TM-201802-L3V95.9.1.he5`, access the dataset at `/HDFEOS/GRIDS/MOP03/Data Fields/RetrievedSurfaceTemperatureDay`, and extract its attributes such as `long_name`, `units`, and `_FillValue`? Also, how do I decode string attributes using the `decode()` method?

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:  
How can I use NumPy to replace values in the dataset that match `_FillValue` with `NaN`, create a masked array using `numpy.ma.masked_array`, and mask invalid or missing data points identified by `numpy.isnan`? Additionally, how do I handle the `_FillValue` attribute extracted from the HDF5 dataset?

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:  
How can I use `Basemap` from `mpl_toolkits.basemap` to create a cylindrical projection map with low resolution, set boundaries from -90 to 90 for latitude and -180 to 180 for longitude, add coastlines with line width 0.5, draw parallels at specific latitudes and meridians with custom labels, and plot the data using `pcolormesh` with `latlon=True`? Also, how do I add a colorbar and label it using the `units` attribute from the dataset?
