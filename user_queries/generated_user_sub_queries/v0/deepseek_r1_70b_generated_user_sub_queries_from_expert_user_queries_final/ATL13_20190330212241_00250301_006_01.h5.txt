        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
        Create a Python script that processes an HDF5 file to generate a geospatial visualization. The script follows these steps:

1. Import Libraries: Include necessary modules for OS operations (os), plotting (matplotlib and matplotlib.pyplot), numerical computations (numpy), map projections (mpl_toolkits.basemap), and handling HDF5 files.

2. Define Constants: Set the FILE_NAME constant to "ATL13_20190330212241_00250301_006_01.h5".

3. Open HDF5 File: Open the file in read mode and access datasets at paths "/gt1l/segment_lat", "/gt1l/segment_lon", and "/gt1l/segment_geoid" for latitude, longitude, and main data respectively.

4. Extract Attributes: For each dataset, read 'units' and 'long_name' attributes using decode('ascii', 'replace') and retrieve '_FillValue' from the main data. Convert main data to float type.

5. Data Processing:
   - Replace _FillValue in main data with numpy NaN.
   - Mask data where values are NaN using numpy's masked_where function.

6. Map Setup: Create a cylindrical projection map with low resolution, setting latitude and longitude bounds from -90 to 90 and -180 to 180 respectively. Add coastlines with line width 0.5, parallels at intervals [-90, 30, 120], and meridians at intervals [-180, 45, 180].

7. Adjust Longitude: Subtract 180 degrees from longitude values before plotting.

8. Plot Data: Use scatter plot with parameters: longitude and latitude coordinates, data as color values (c=data), marker size 0.1, colormap 'jet', no edge colors, and zero linewidth.

9. Add Visualization Elements:
   - Include a colorbar at the bottom labeled with the main dataset's units.
   - Set the title to include the HDF5 file's basename and its long_name attribute.

This structured approach ensures clarity for code generation by an LLM.

Okay, so I need to break down the user's query into three specific sub-queries. Let me start by understanding what each part of their task entails.

First, they want a Python script that processes an HDF5 file for geospatial visualization. The steps are detailed, from importing libraries to plotting. My job is to split this into three focused areas: HDF5 access, NumPy preprocessing, and map plotting.

Looking at the first sub-query, it's about accessing the HDF5 file using h5py. They mentioned specific file extensions like H5, h5, etc., so I should include those. Also, they need to access datasets at certain paths and read attributes like 'units' and 'long_name'. Plus, extracting '_FillValue' is important for data processing.

Next, the NumPy part involves handling the _FillValue by replacing it with NaNs and masking the data. They specified using functions like np.where or np.ma.masked_where. I should make sure to include these methods in the sub-query so that relevant examples can be found.

Lastly, the visualization part uses matplotlib and basemap. The user wants a cylindrical projection with specific bounds and elements like coastlines, parallels, and meridians. They also mentioned adjusting longitude by subtracting 180 degrees before plotting. Including details about adding a colorbar and title will help in retrieving the right examples for this section.

I need to ensure each sub-query is concise and targets only the specified technical domains so that the vector database can fetch the most relevant resources.

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:  
How do I use `h5py` to open an HDF5 file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5 and access datasets at paths like `/gt1l/segment_lat`, `/gt1l/segment_lon`, and `/gt1l/segment_geoid`? Additionally, how do I read 'units' and 'long_name' attributes using `decode('ascii', 'replace')` and retrieve '_FillValue' from the main dataset?

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:  
How can I replace `_FillValue` in NumPy arrays with NaN and mask data where values are NaN using `np.ma.masked_where`? What methods are available to handle missing or invalid data during preprocessing?

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:  
What is the process for creating a cylindrical projection map with low resolution using `matplotlib` and `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, setting latitude and longitude bounds from -90 to 90 and -180 to 180, respectively? How do I add coastlines, parallels at intervals [-90, 30, 120], and meridians at intervals [-180, 45, 180]? Additionally, how can I adjust longitude values by subtracting 180 degrees before plotting and use a scatter plot with parameters like marker size, colormap 'jet', and no edge colors? Finally, how do I include a colorbar labeled with the main dataset's units and set the title to include the HDF5 file's basename and its long_name attribute?
