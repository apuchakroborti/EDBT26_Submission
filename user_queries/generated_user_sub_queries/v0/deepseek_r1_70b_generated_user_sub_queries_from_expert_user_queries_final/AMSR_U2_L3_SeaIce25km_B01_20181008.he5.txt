        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
        Write a Python script that processes and visualizes data from an HDF-EOS5 file by following these steps:

1. Import necessary libraries: os, pyproj, re, matplotlib.pyplot as plt, mpl_toolkits.basemap.Basemap, numpy as np.

2. Define constants for the main dataset path ('/HDFEOS/GRIDS/NpPolarGrid25km/Data Fields/SI_25km_NH_89V_DAY') and grid metadata path ('/HDFEOS INFORMATION/StructMetadata.0').

3. Create a function that takes a file name as input, opens the HDF-EOS5 file, extracts metadata, and retrieves projection parameters.

4. Convert the main dataset to numpy.float64 using astype.

5. Preprocess the data by:
   - Setting values equal to 0 to NaN.
   - Scaling the data by multiplying with 0.1.
   - Creating a masked array using numpy.ma.masked_array where data is invalid.

6. Construct the grid using extracted projection parameters and data shape, then transform coordinates from EASE Grid to WGS84 using pyproj.

7. Create a map using Basemap with:
   - npstere projection.
   - Low resolution.
   - boundinglat=33 and lon_0=0.
   - Coastlines with linewidth 0.5.
   - Parallels at latitudes [0, 90, 20] with labels [1, 0, 0, 0].
   - Meridians at longitudes [-180, 181, 45] with labels [0, 0, 0, 1].

8. Add a pcolormesh layer using longitude, latitude, and data with latlon=True.

9. Include a colorbar labeled with the main dataset's units.

10. Set the plot title to include the file basename and the main dataset's long_name containing 'SI_25km_NH_89V_DAY'.

This structured approach ensures clarity and technical accuracy for generating the required code.

Okay, so I need to break down this user's query into three specific sub-queries. Let me start by understanding what the user is asking for.

The user wants a Python script that processes and visualizes data from an HDF-EOS5 file. They've outlined ten steps, each detailing different parts of the process. My task is to split this into three focused areas: HDF5 access, NumPy preprocessing, and map plotting.

First, looking at step 1-4, they're importing libraries and defining paths for datasets and metadata in the HDF file. So the first sub-query should focus on accessing these specific parts using h5py. I'll need to mention how to open the file, read the dataset, and extract metadata like projection parameters.

Next, steps 5 involve preprocessing the data with NumPy. They want to set zeros to NaN, scale data, and create masked arrays. So the second sub-query should target these operations using functions like np.where or np.ma.masked_array. I'll make sure to include handling _FillValue and scaling here.

Then, steps 6-10 are about mapping and visualization with Basemap. They specify projection parameters, transforming coordinates, setting up the map with coastlines, parallels, meridians, adding a pcolormesh layer, colorbar, and title. The third sub-query needs to cover using Basemap for this setup, including projections and decorations.

I should ensure each sub-query is concise and targets only the relevant technical areas without overlapping. That way, each can be addressed with specific documentation or examples from their respective domains.
