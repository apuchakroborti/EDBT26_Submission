        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
        File Input and Constants
- Specify the input file as `MOP02J-20131129-L2V19.9.3.he5` stored in the constant `FILE_NAME`.
- Import necessary libraries: `os`, `datetime`, `h5py`, `numpy` as `np`, `matplotlib` as `mpl`, `matplotlib.pyplot` as `plt`, and `mpl_toolkits.basemap.Basemap`.

Extracting Data
- Extract data from the HDF5 dataset at `/HDFEOS/SWATHS/MOP02/Data Fields/RetrievedSurfaceTemperature`.
- Read the first column of this dataset into an array named `data`.
- Retrieve the `units` and `_FillValue` attributes associated with this dataset.
- Decode the `units` string using the `decode()` function.

Data Preprocessing and Cleaning
- Replace values in `data` that match `_FillValue` with `numpy.nan`.

Extracting Geolocation Data
- Extract latitude data from `/HDFEOS/SWATHS/MOP02/Geolocation Fields/Latitude`.
- Extract longitude data from `/HDFEOS/SWATHS/MOP02/Geolocation Fields/Longitude`.

Creating a Map
- Add coastlines with a line width of 0.5.
- Draw parallels using `numpy.arange(-90, 91, 45)`.
- Draw meridians using `numpy.arange(-180, 180, 45)` and set labels to `[True, False, False, True]`.

Scatter Plot Configuration
- Use the `scatter` function with parameters: longitude, latitude, `c=data`, marker size `s=1`, colormap `plt.cm.jet`, no edge colors (`edgecolors=None`), and line width `linewidth=0`.

Customizing the Map
- Add a colorbar to represent data units.
- Set the colorbar label using the decoded `units` value.

Okay, so I need to break down this user query into three specific sub-queries. Let me start by reading through the entire query carefully.

The user is working with an HDF5 file, specifically MOP02J-20131129-L2V19.9.3.he5. They want to extract data from certain paths and process it using NumPy, then visualize it on a map. 

First, I'll focus on the HDF5 part. The user wants to access datasets at specific paths like /HDFEOS/SWATHS/MOP02/Data Fields/RetrievedSurfaceTemperature and also retrieve attributes such as units and _FillValue. They're using h5py for this, so the sub-query should cover accessing these datasets and their metadata.

Next, the data preprocessing involves replacing _FillValue with NaNs in NumPy. The user is using np.where or masked_where, so I need to make sure that's included in the second sub-query along with any other filtering based on min, max, etc.

Lastly, for visualization, they're using Basemap from mpl_toolkits. They want to draw coastlines, meridians, and parallels with specific parameters. Also, a scatter plot with certain markers and a colorbar is needed. The third sub-query should focus on these aspects of plotting.

I need to ensure each sub-query is concise and targets the exact technical domain without overlapping. Let me structure them accordingly.

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:  
How to access HDF5 datasets using `h5py` at paths like `/HDFEOS/SWATHS/MOP02/Data Fields/RetrievedSurfaceTemperature`, read attributes such as `units` and `_FillValue`, and decode strings using the `decode()` function.

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:  
How to replace values in a NumPy array that match `_FillValue` with `numpy.nan` and apply preprocessing logic like masking or filtering data using `np.where` or `np.ma.masked_where`.

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:  
How to create a map using `mpl_toolkits.basemap.Basemap`, add coastlines, draw parallels and meridians with specific ranges and labels, configure a scatter plot with longitude and latitude coordinates, and customize the visualization with colorbars and titles.
