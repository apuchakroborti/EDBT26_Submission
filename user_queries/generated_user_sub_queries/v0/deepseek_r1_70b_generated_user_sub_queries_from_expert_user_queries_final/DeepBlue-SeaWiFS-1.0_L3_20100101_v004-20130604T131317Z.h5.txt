        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
        Write a Python script that performs the following tasks:

1. Import necessary libraries: os, h5py, matplotlib, matplotlib.pyplot, mpl_toolkits.basemap, numpy.

2. Read data from an HDF5 file named "DeepBlue-SeaWiFS-1.0_L3_20100101_v004-20130604T131317Z.h5".

3. Extract the following datasets:
   - aerosol_optical_thickness_550_ocean
   - latitude
   - longitude

4. Retrieve attributes from the aerosol_optical_thickness_550_ocean dataset:
   - long_name
   - _FillValue

5. Decode the long_name attribute using the decode() function.

6. Replace all data points matching _FillValue with NaN values in the aerosol_optical_thickness_550_ocean dataset.

7. Create a masked array of the aerosol_optical_thickness_550_ocean data where NaN values are masked.

8. Generate a cylindrical projection map with:
   - Low resolution
   - Latitude range from -90 to 90
   - Longitude range from -180 to 180

9. Add map features:
   - Coastlines with line width 0.5
   - Parallels at latitudes [-90, 30, 60]
   - Meridians at longitudes [-180, -45, 45, 180]

10. Create a pcolormesh plot of the masked aerosol data on the map:
    - Use longitude and latitude coordinates
    - Set color scale from 0 to 1 (vmin=0, vmax=1)
    - Ensure latlon=True for geographic projection

11. Add a colorbar to the plot.

Okay, so I need to break down this user's query into three specific sub-queries. Let me start by understanding what each part of the task entails.

First, the user wants a Python script that does several things with HDF5 data and visualization. They've listed 11 steps, from importing libraries to creating a map plot. My job is to split this into three focused areas: HDF5 access, NumPy preprocessing, and plotting with mapping tools.

Looking at step 2, they're using h5py to read an HDF5 file. So the first sub-query should cover accessing the file, extracting datasets like 'aerosol_optical_thickness_550_ocean', 'latitude', and 'longitude'. Also, retrieving attributes from that dataset, specifically 'long_name' and '_FillValue', and decoding the long_name.

Next, steps 5-7 involve NumPy operations. They need to replace _FillValue with NaNs and create a masked array. So the second sub-query should focus on using np.where or np.ma.masked_where for masking and handling the fill value.

Finally, steps 8-11 are about visualization. Using basemap to create a cylindrical projection, adding coastlines, parallels, meridians, and plotting the data with pcolormesh. The third sub-query needs to cover these aspects, including setting up the map features and plotting parameters.

I should make sure each sub-query is concise and targets only the relevant technical areas so that the user can find specific documentation or examples for each part.
