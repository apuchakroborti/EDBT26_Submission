        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
        

Create a script to visualize precipitation rate data from an HDF5 file by following these steps:

1. Import Libraries: Use os, matplotlib, matplotlib.pyplot, numpy, mpl_toolkits.basemap, and h5py.

2. Open HDF5 File: Access the file in read-only mode and extract the `/FS/SLV/precipRateESurface` dataset along with its units and _FillValue attribute.

3. Handle Missing Data: Replace _FillValue entries with NaNs using numpy's masked_where function to mask the data where values are NaN.

4. Retrieve Geolocation Data: Extract latitude from `/FS/Latitude` and longitude from `/FS/Longitude`.

5. Set Up Map Projection: Create a cylindrical projection with low resolution, spanning latitudes from -90 to 90 and longitudes from -180 to 180.

6. Customize Map: Add coastlines (width 0.5), parallels at [-90, 0, 90], and meridians at [-180, 0, 180] with specific labels.

7. Plot Data: Use a scatter plot with the 'jet' colormap, point size of 1, based on longitude and latitude coordinates.

8. Add Colorbar and Title: Include a colorbar below the plot, labeled with the dataset's units, and set the title to reflect the file and dataset name.

Okay, so I need to create a script that visualizes precipitation rate data from an HDF5 file. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll start with accessing the HDF5 file using h5py. The user mentioned specific extensions like H5, h5, etc., so I should make sure my code can handle those. I need to open the file in read-only mode, which is important because I don't want to modify the data accidentally.

Next, I have to extract the dataset `/FS/SLV/precipRateESurface`. Along with that, I also need its units and the _FillValue attribute. Units are crucial for labeling the colorbar correctly, and _FillValue will help me identify missing or invalid data points.

Now, handling missing data is next. The user wants to replace _FillValue entries with NaNs using numpy's masked_where function. I remember that np.ma.masked_where can create a masked array where certain conditions are met, which in this case would be values equal to _FillValue. This way, those points won't show up on the plot.

After that, I need to retrieve the geolocation data: latitude from `/FS/Latitude` and longitude from `/FS/Longitude`. These coordinates are essential for plotting the data correctly on the map. Without them, the visualization wouldn't align with real-world geography.

Setting up the map projection is another key step. The user specified a cylindrical projection with low resolution. I think using mpl_toolkits.basemap would be appropriate here. I'll set the boundaries from -90 to 90 for latitudes and -180 to 180 for longitudes, which covers the entire globe.

Customizing the map involves adding coastlines, parallels, and meridians. Coastlines should have a width of 0.5 for visibility without being too thick. Parallels at [-90, 0, 90] and meridians at [-180, 0, 180] will provide clear latitude and longitude markers. I'll also need to label these appropriately so the map is easy to read.

Plotting the data as a scatter plot with the 'jet' colormap makes sense for precipitation rates. The point size should be small (size=1) to avoid overlapping too much. Using longitude and latitude coordinates will place each data point in its correct geographical location.

Finally, adding a colorbar below the plot labeled with the dataset's units is important for understanding the scale of precipitation rates. The title of the plot should include both the file name and the dataset name for clarity.

I think I've covered all the steps. Now, I'll structure each part into sub-queries as specified.

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
Access HDF5 file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5 in read-only mode using `h5py`, extract dataset `/FS/SLV/precipRateESurface` along with its units and _FillValue attribute.

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
Replace _FillValue entries with NaNs using numpy's masked_where function to mask the data where values are NaN, handle missing data by applying masks with `np.where` or `np.ma.masked_where`.

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
Use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to create a cylindrical projection with low resolution spanning latitudes from -90 to 90 and longitudes from -180 to 180, add coastlines (width 0.5), parallels at [-90, 0, 90], meridians at [-180, 0, 180] with labels, plot data using scatter plot with 'jet' colormap, point size of 1 based on longitude and latitude coordinates, include colorbar below the plot labeled with dataset's units, set title reflecting file and dataset name.
