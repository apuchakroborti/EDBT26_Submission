        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
        Create a Python script that reads an HDF5 file and generates a map visualization by following these steps:

1. Import Libraries: Include os, matplotlib, matplotlib.pyplot, numpy, mpl_toolkits.basemap, and h5py.

2. Read HDF5 File: Open the file `AMSR_E_L2_Land_V11_201110031920_D.he5` in read-only mode.

3. Extract Data:
   - Retrieve main data from the attribute 'SoilMoistureSCA' at `/HDFEOS/POINTS/AMSR-E Level 2 Land Data/Data/Combined NPD and SCA Output Fields`.
   - Extract latitude data from `/HDFEOS/POINTS/AMSR-E Level 2 Land Data/Data/Combined NPD and SCA Output Fields/Latitude`.
   - Extract longitude data from `/HDFEOS/POINTS/AMSR-E Level 2 Land Data/Data/Combined NPD and SCA Output Fields/Longitude`.

4. Data Cleaning:
   - Assign a static _FillValue of -9999.0.
   - Replace values matching _FillValue with numpy NaN.
   - Mask data using numpy's masked_array where values are not NaN.

5. Create Map:
   - Use an equidistant cylindrical projection with low resolution.
   - Set latitude range from -90 to 90 and longitude from -170 to 190.
   - Add coastlines with a linewidth of 0.5.
   - Draw parallels using numpy arrange with values -90, 91, 45 and labels [1, 0, 0, 0].
   - Draw meridians using numpy arrange with values -180, 181, 45 and labels [0, 0, 0, 1].

6. Scatter Plot:
   - Use longitude and latitude data.
   - Set parameters: marker size (s=0.1), colormap (plt.cm.jet), edgecolors=None, linewidth=0.

7. Add Colorbar and Title:
   - Include a colorbar labeled with the dataset's units.
   - Set title to include the file basename and 'SoilMoistureSCA'.

Okay, so I need to break down this user's query into three specific sub-queries. Let me start by understanding what the user is asking for.

The main task is to create a Python script that reads an HDF5 file and generates a map visualization. The steps are detailed, from importing libraries to plotting. My job is to split this into three focused areas: HDF5 access, NumPy preprocessing, and map plotting.

First, looking at the HDF5 part. The user wants to read specific datasets and attributes from an HE5 file using h5py. So I need to focus on how to open the file, navigate the groups, and extract the necessary data. The paths given are quite detailed, so the sub-query should target accessing those exact locations.

Next, the NumPy preprocessing step involves handling _FillValue and masking. The user wants to replace -9999.0 with NaNs and create a masked array. I need to make sure this sub-query covers using np.where or np.ma.masked_where for masking and applying min/max or other filters as needed.

Lastly, the visualization part uses matplotlib and basemap. The user specified an equidistant cylindrical projection, certain latitude and longitude ranges, coastlines, parallels, meridians, a scatter plot with specific parameters, and adding colorbars and titles. So this sub-query should focus on setting up the map correctly with all these elements.

I need to ensure each sub-query is concise and targets only the relevant technical areas so that documentation can be retrieved effectively.

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:  
How to use `h5py` to open an HDF5 file named `AMSR_E_L2_Land_V11_201110031920_D.he5` in read-only mode, access datasets at paths `/HDFEOS/POINTS/AMSR-E Level 2 Land Data/Data/Combined NPD and SCA Output Fields`, extract the `SoilMoistureSCA` attribute, and retrieve latitude and longitude data from their respective paths.

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:  
How to assign a static `_FillValue` of -9999.0, replace values matching `_FillValue` with NumPy NaN using `np.where` or `np.ma.masked_where`, and create a masked array where values are not NaN for data cleaning.

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:  
How to use `matplotlib` and `mpl_toolkits.basemap` to create an equidistant cylindrical projection map with low resolution, set latitude range from -90 to 90 and longitude from -170 to 190, add coastlines with linewidth 0.5, draw parallels using numpy arrange with values -90, 91, 45 and labels [1, 0, 0, 0], draw meridians using numpy arrange with values -180, 181, 45 and labels [0, 0, 0, 1].
