        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
        I am working with an HDF5 file containing SMAP Level 1C data. The script should begin by importing necessary libraries: os, datetime, h5py, numpy as np, matplotlib as mpl, matplotlib.pyplot as plt, and mpl_toolkits.basemap import Basemap.

Define a constant `filename` with the value "SMAP_L1C_TB_50719_D_20240730T124417_R19240_001.h5".

The program should read this HDF5 file in read-only mode. Access the main dataset at "/Global_Projection/cell_tb_h_fore" and geolocation datasets at "/Global_Projection/cell_lat" (latitude) and "/Global_Projection/cell_lon" (longitude).

Extract attributes from the cell_tb_h_fore dataset: units, long_name, _FillValue, valid_max, and valid_min. Decode these attributes using 'ascii' encoding with 'replace' as the error handling parameter.

Identify invalid data by combining two conditions using numpy's logical_or: values greater than valid_max or less than valid_min. Update this mask to include values equal to _FillValue. Replace invalid data in cell_tb_h_fore with NaNs and create a masked array using numpy's masked_where function, checking for NaNs.

For visualization, initialize a Basemap object with a cylindrical projection. Set map boundaries from -90 to 90 latitude and -180 to 180 longitude. Add coastlines with a line width of 0.5. Draw parallels at intervals of 45 degrees and meridians at the same interval, labeling them as [True, False, False, True].

Create a scatter plot using longitude and latitude coordinates, with data from cell_tb_h_fore, point size 1, colormap 'jet', no edge color, and linewidth 0. Add a colorbar below the plot with 10% padding and label it with the units attribute.

Set the plot title to the concatenation of the filename's basename and long_name, using fontsize 7.

Okay, so I need to break down this user's query into three specific sub-queries. Let me read through the problem again carefully.

The user is working with an HDF5 file containing SMAP Level 1C data. They provided a detailed script outline that involves importing libraries, reading the HDF5 file, accessing datasets, extracting attributes, preprocessing data with NumPy, and visualizing using Basemap.

First, I'll focus on the HDF5 part. The user wants to access specific datasets: cell_tb_h_fore for the main data, and cell_lat and cell_lon for geolocation. They also need to extract attributes like units, long_name, _FillValue, valid_max, and valid_min from cell_tb_h_fore. These attributes should be decoded using 'ascii' with 'replace' handling.

Next, the NumPy preprocessing step involves identifying invalid data. The user wants to combine two conditions: values greater than valid_max or less than valid_min. Then, they want to include values equal to _FillValue in this mask. After that, replace invalid data with NaNs and create a masked array using numpy's masked_where.

For visualization, the user is using Basemap with a cylindrical projection. They set boundaries from -90 to 90 latitude and -180 to 180 longitude. Coastlines are added with line width 0.5. Parallels and meridians at 45-degree intervals, labeled in a specific pattern. A scatter plot of the data with certain parameters like colormap 'jet', point size 1, etc., and a colorbar below with padding and label from units.

Now, I need to translate each part into sub-queries without any extra text, just the queries as per the format.

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
How do I access the HDF5 file "SMAP_L1C_TB_50719_D_20240730T124417_R19240_001.h5" in read-only mode using h5py? What is the correct way to retrieve datasets from "/Global_Projection/cell_tb_h_fore", "/Global_Projection/cell_lat", and "/Global_Projection/cell_lon"? How can I extract attributes like units, long_name, _FillValue, valid_max, and valid_min from the dataset "/Global_Projection/cell_tb_h_fore" and decode them using 'ascii' encoding with error handling set to 'replace'?

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
How do I identify invalid data by combining conditions where values are greater than valid_max or less than valid_min using numpy's logical_or? How can I update this mask to include values equal to _FillValue? What is the correct method to replace invalid data in the dataset with NaNs and create a masked array using numpy's masked_where function?

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
How do I initialize a Basemap object with a cylindrical projection and set the map boundaries from -90 to 90 latitude and -180 to 180 longitude? What are the steps to add coastlines with a line width of 0.5, draw parallels and meridians at 45-degree intervals, and label them as [True, False, False, True]? How can I create a scatter plot using longitude and latitude coordinates with point size 1, colormap 'jet', no edge color, and linewidth 0? What is the proper way to add a colorbar below the plot with 10% padding and label it with the units attribute? How do I set the plot title to include the filename's basename and long_name with fontsize 7?
