        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
        Create a Python script that processes and visualizes HDF data using specific libraries and steps.

1. Imports: Include necessary libraries such as `os`, `datetime`, `h5py`, `numpy` as `np`, `matplotlib` as `mpl`, `matplotlib.pyplot` as `plt`, and `Basemap` from `mpl_toolkits.basemap`.

2. Read HDF Data: Access the dataset `/HDFEOS/GRIDS/MOP03/Data Fields/RetrievedSurfaceTemperatureDay` into a variable named `data`. Extract attributes `long_name`, `units`, and `_FillValue`, decoding `long_name` and `units`.

3. Data Preprocessing:
   - Replace `_FillValue` with `NaN`.
   - Mask data using `numpy.ma.masked_array` where values are not `NaN`.

4. Geolocation Data: Read latitude and longitude from respective datasets into variables `x` and `y`, then create a meshgrid.

5. Basemap Setup:
   - Use cylindrical projection with low resolution.
   - Set boundaries from -90 to 90 for latitude and -180 to 180 for longitude.
   - Add coastlines, parallels at intervals of 45 degrees, and meridians similarly, labeling the first and last ones.

6. Visualization: 
   - Use `plt.scatter` with parameters including data, colormap 'jet', no edge colors, and linewidth 0.
   - Add a colorbar labeled with the units attribute.

7. Cleanup: Include `plt.show()` or save the figure as needed.

Okay, so I need to break down this user query into three specific sub-queries. The main task is to create a Python script that processes and visualizes HDF data using certain libraries. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, the user wants to access an HDF5 dataset. They specified using h5py, so I should focus on how to read the file and extract the necessary datasets and attributes. The path given is `/HDFEOS/GRIDS/MOP03/Data Fields/RetrievedSurfaceTemperatureDay`, and they need to get `long_name`, `units`, and `_FillValue`. Also, decoding these attributes is important.

Next, for data preprocessing with NumPy, the user wants to replace the fill value with NaN and mask the data. I should think about using functions like np.where or masked_array. Handling missing values correctly is crucial here to ensure the data is properly processed before visualization.

Lastly, the visualization part uses Basemap. They want a cylindrical projection with specific boundaries and elements like coastlines, parallels, and meridians. Using matplotlib for plotting and adding a colorbar with the correct units is also part of this step.

I need to make sure each sub-query is clear and targets only the specified technical domains so that relevant resources can be found easily.
