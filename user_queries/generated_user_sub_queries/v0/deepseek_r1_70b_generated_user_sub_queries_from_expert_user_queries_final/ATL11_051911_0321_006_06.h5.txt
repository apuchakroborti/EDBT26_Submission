        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
        Create a Python script that processes an HDF5 file containing geospatial data. The script should follow these steps:

1. Import Necessary Libraries: Include libraries for OS operations (os), plotting (matplotlib and matplotlib.pyplot), numerical computations (numpy), map projections (mpl_toolkits.basemap), and handling HDF5 files.

2. Define Constants: Set a constant `FILE_NAME` to the path "ICESat_2/ATL11_051911_0321_006_06.h5".

3. Open and Read HDF5 File: Open the file in read mode and access the datasets `/pt1/latitude`, `/pt1/longitude`, and `/pt1/h_corr`. Extract attributes `units` and `long_name` using decoding with 'ascii' and 'replace', and retrieve `_FillValue`.

4. Data Preprocessing:
   - Convert main data to float.
   - Replace `_FillValue` with numpy NaN.
   - Mask data where values are NaN.

5. Create Map Projection: Use an equidistant cylindrical projection with low resolution, setting latitude from -90 to 90 and longitude from -180 to 180.

6. Customize Map:
   - Add coastlines with a line width of 0.5.
   - Draw parallels at intervals of 30 degrees starting from -90.
   - Draw meridians every 45 degrees.

7. Generate Scatter Plot: Create a scatter plot using longitude and latitude coordinates, with data as the color variable. Use a marker size of 0.1, jet colormap, no edge colors, and no line widths.

8. Add Colorbar and Title:
   - Attach a colorbar below the map, labeled with the dataset's units.
   - Set the title to include the file basename, dataset path, and long_name from attributes.

This structured approach ensures each step is clear for code generation by an LLM.

Okay, so I need to break down this user's query into three specific sub-queries. Let me read through the problem again carefully.

The user wants a Python script that processes an HDF5 file with geospatial data. They've outlined eight steps, from importing libraries to creating a scatter plot and adding a colorbar and title. My task is to split this into three focused sub-queries targeting HDF5 access, NumPy preprocessing, and map plotting.

First, I'll look at the HDF5 part. The user mentions opening the file, accessing specific datasets like `/pt1/latitude`, extracting attributes, and handling `_FillValue`. So the sub-query should focus on using `h5py` to read these datasets and their attributes, including decoding and retrieving fill values.

Next is NumPy preprocessing. The steps here involve converting data to float, replacing fill values with NaNs, and masking. I need to frame this as a sub-query about handling `_FillValue`, applying masks with NumPy functions like `np.where` or `np.ma.masked_where`.

Lastly, the plotting part uses `matplotlib` and `basemap`. The user wants an equidistant cylindrical projection, coastlines, parallels, meridians, a scatter plot with specific markers, colormap, colorbar, and title. So the sub-query should cover setting up this map and customizing it as described.

I need to ensure each sub-query is concise and targets only the relevant technical domain so that documentation or examples can be easily retrieved.

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:  
How do I use `h5py` to open an HDF5 file, access datasets at paths `/pt1/latitude`, `/pt1/longitude`, and `/pt1/h_corr`, extract their attributes (`units` and `long_name`) with decoding using 'ascii' and 'replace', and retrieve the `_FillValue`?

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:  
How do I convert data to float, replace `_FillValue` with NaN using NumPy, and mask the data where values are NaN?

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:  
How do I create an equidistant cylindrical projection map with low resolution using `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, add coastlines with line width 0.5, draw parallels at 30-degree intervals from -90 to 90, draw meridians every 45 degrees, generate a scatter plot with longitude and latitude coordinates as the color variable (marker size 0.1, jet colormap, no edge colors or line widths), add a colorbar below the map labeled with dataset units, and set the title to include file basename, dataset path, and long_name from attributes?
