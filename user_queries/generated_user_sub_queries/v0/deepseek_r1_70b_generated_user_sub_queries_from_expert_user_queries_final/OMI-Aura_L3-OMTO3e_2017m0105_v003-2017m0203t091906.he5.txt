        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
        Create Python code that performs the following steps:

1. Import necessary libraries: os, datetime, h5py, numpy as np, matplotlib as mpl, matplotlib.pyplot as plt, and Basemap from mpl_toolkits.basemap.

2. Define two constants:
   - FILE_NAME: Path to the input HDF5 file "OMI-Aura_L3-OMTO3e_2017m0105_v003-2017m0203t091906.he5".
   - DATAFIELD_NAME: Path to the dataset "/HDFEOS/GRIDS/OMI Column Amount O3/Data Fields/ColumnAmountO3".

3. Open the HDF5 file in read mode and access the dataset specified by DATAFIELD_NAME.

4. Read the entire dataset into memory, replacing _FillValue with NaN using numpy's isnan function to create a mask.

5. Generate synthetic geolocation data:
   - Create longitude values from -179.875 to 179.875 with 1440 points.
   - Create latitude values from -89.875 to 89.875 with 720 points.

6. Extract the 'title' and 'units' attributes from the dataset, decoding them from bytes to UTF-8 strings.

7. Use Basemap to create a cylindrical projection map:
   - Set resolution to 'low'.
   - Define latitude bounds from -90 to 90 and longitude bounds from -180 to 180.
   - Add coastlines with a line width of 0.5.
   - Draw parallels at latitudes [-90, 30, 60] with labels [1, 0, 0, 0].
   - Draw meridians at longitudes [-180, -45, 0, 45, 180] with labels [0, 0, 0, 1].

8. Plot the data using pcolormesh:
   - Use longitude and latitude arrays for coordinates.
   - Set latlon=True and colormap to 'jet'.

9. Add a colorbar with labels set to the extracted units attribute.

Okay, so I need to break down this user query into three specific sub-queries. Let me read through the problem again.

The user wants Python code that does several steps involving HDF5 access, data preprocessing with NumPy, and visualization using Basemap. My task is to split this into three focused parts: HDF5 access, NumPy preprocessing, and plotting with Basemap.

First, for the HDF5 part, I need to focus on accessing the file and dataset. The user uses h5py to open the HE5 file and access a specific path. So the sub-query should mention using h5py, opening the file in read mode, accessing the dataset by its full path, and handling attributes.

Next, the NumPy part involves reading data, replacing _FillValue with NaNs, and creating masks. The user uses np.isnan to create a mask, so I need to include that. Also, applying min and max might be part of preprocessing, so that should be in the sub-query.

Lastly, for plotting, Basemap is used with specific parameters like resolution, bounds, coastlines, parallels, meridians, and labels. The sub-query should cover setting up the map projection, adding geographical features, and configuring their appearance.

I need to make sure each sub-query is concise and only covers its domain without overlapping into others. So I'll structure them separately as per the instructions.

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:  
How do I use `h5py` to open an HDF5 file in read mode (`'r'`) and access a dataset by its full path (e.g., `/HDFEOS/GRIDS/OMI Column Amount O3/Data Fields/ColumnAmountO3`)? Additionally, how can I extract the 'title' and 'units' attributes from the dataset and decode them from bytes to UTF-8 strings?

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:  
How do I use NumPy to read the entire HDF5 dataset into memory while replacing the `_FillValue` with NaN using `np.isnan()`? Additionally, how can I apply masks using `np.where` or `np.ma.masked_where` and compute or filter data based on `min` and `max` values?

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:  
How do I use `Basemap` from `mpl_toolkits.basemap` to create a cylindrical projection map with low resolution, define latitude bounds (-90 to 90) and longitude bounds (-180 to 180), add coastlines with line width 0.5, draw parallels at specific latitudes with custom labels, and draw meridians at specific longitudes with custom labels?
