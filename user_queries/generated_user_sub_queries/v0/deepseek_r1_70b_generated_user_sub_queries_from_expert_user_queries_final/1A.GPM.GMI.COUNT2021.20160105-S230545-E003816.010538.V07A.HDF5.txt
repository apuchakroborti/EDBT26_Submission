        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
        A Python script that visualizes data from an HDF5 file by following these structured steps:

1. Import necessary libraries: os, matplotlib, matplotlib.pyplot, numpy, mpl_toolkits.basemap, and h5py.

2. Load Data:
   - Open the HDF5 file using h5py.
   - Extract datasets:
     - 'solarAzimuthAngle' from path /S2/solarAzimuthAngle.
     - 'latitude' from path /S2/Latitude.
     - 'longitude' from path /S2/Longitude.
   - Retrieve attributes 'units' and '_FillValue' from the solarAzimuthAngle dataset.

3. Process Solar Azimuth Angle Data:
   - Replace _FillValue with NaN in the solarAzimuthAngle data.
   - Mask NaN values to handle missing data appropriately.

4. Create Map and Plot Data:
   - Initialize a cylindrical map projection using Basemap.
   - Set map boundaries with low resolution, latitude range from -90 to 90, and longitude range from -180 to 180.
   - Add coastlines with line width 0.5.
   - Draw parallels at intervals of every 45 degrees (using numpy.arange for values -90, 91) and meridians at the same intervals with labels [True, False, False, True].

5. Add Colorbar and Title:
   - Use matplotlib's scatter function to plot longitude and latitude data points.
   - Apply colormap plt.cm.jet with no edge color and linewidth 0.
   - Create a colorbar below the plot with padding of 10% and label it using the 'units' attribute from solarAzimuthAngle.

Okay, so I need to break down this user's query into three specific sub-queries. Let me start by understanding what the user is asking for.

The user provided a Python script outline that involves reading an HDF5 file, processing the data with NumPy, and then visualizing it using Basemap. They want me to split this task into three focused parts: accessing the HDF5 data, preprocessing with NumPy, and plotting with visualization tools.

First, I'll tackle the HDF5 part. The user is using h5py to open the file and extract specific datasets from certain paths. They also need to retrieve attributes like 'units' and '_FillValue'. So my sub-query should focus on how to access these elements using h5py.

Next, for NumPy preprocessing, the user wants to replace _FillValue with NaNs and mask those values. I'll need to find examples or documentation that show using np.where or masked arrays to handle this data processing step effectively.

Lastly, the visualization part uses Basemap to create a map projection, draw coastlines, parallels, meridians, and add a colorbar. My sub-query here should target how to set up these elements using matplotlib and Basemap, ensuring the plot is correctly formatted with the right projections and labels.

I need to make sure each sub-query is specific to its technical domain so that relevant resources can be easily found. I'll avoid any extra explanations and stick strictly to the required format.
