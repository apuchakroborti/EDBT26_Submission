        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
        1. Import Necessary Libraries:  
   Import the required libraries for handling OS functions, creating visualizations, numerical computations, map projections, and HDF5 files: `os`, `matplotlib`, `matplotlib.pyplot`, `numpy`, and `mpl_toolkits.basemap`.

2. Define Constants:  
   Set a constant `FILE_NAME` to the path of the HDF5 file: `ATL17_20201201000814_10360901_005_01.h5`.

3. Open HDF5 File and Access Datasets:  
   Open the HDF5 file in read mode and access three datasets: `/global_grid_lat` (latitude data), `/global_grid_lon` (longitude data), and `/global_asr` (main data).

4. Read Dataset Attributes:  
   Extract attributes `units` and `long_name` from the main dataset using `decode('ascii', 'replace')`. Also, retrieve the `_FillValue` attribute.

5. Data Processing and Cleaning:  
   - Convert the main dataset's `_FillValue` to `numpy NaN`.
   - Mask the data using `numpy.ma.masked_where` with conditions `numpy.isnan(data)` and `data`.

6. Create Map Projection:  
   Use a cylindrical projection map with low resolution, setting latitude bounds from -90 to 90 and longitude bounds from -180 to 180.

7. Customize Map Features:  
   - Add coastlines with a line width of 0.5.
   - Draw parallels at intervals of [-90, -60, -30, 0, 30, 60, 90] using `numpy.arange`.
   - Draw meridians at intervals of [-180, -135, -90, -45, 0, 45, 90, 135, 180] using `numpy.arange`.

8. Adjust Longitude Values:  
   Subtract 180 from longitude values before plotting to ensure correct map projection.

9. Plot Data on Map:  
   Use `pcolormesh` to plot the data with parameters: longitude, latitude, data, and `latlon=True`.

10. Add Colorbar and Title:  
    - Add a colorbar to the map, positioned at the bottom, labeled with the main dataset's units.
    - Set the title of the map to include the file basename and the `long_name` attribute from the dataset.

This structured approach ensures clarity and technical accuracy for generating the required code.

Okay, so I'm trying to break down this data science task into smaller parts. The user has given a detailed query with 10 steps, and they want me to split it into three focused sub-queries. Each sub-query should target a specific technical domain: HDF5 access, NumPy preprocessing, and map plotting.

First, looking at the user's original query, I see that steps 1 through 4 deal with importing libraries and accessing HDF5 datasets. So for the first sub-query, I need to focus on using h5py to open the file and retrieve specific datasets and their attributes. That includes extracting units, long_name, and _FillValue.

Next, steps 5 and beyond involve processing the data with NumPy. The user mentions converting _FillValue to NaN and masking data. So the second sub-query should cover how to handle these fill values and apply masks using numpy functions like np.where or np.ma.masked_where.

Finally, steps 6 through 10 are about creating a map projection and visualizing the data. This involves using matplotlib and basemap to set up the projection, draw coastlines and grid lines, adjust longitude values, plot the data with pcolormesh, and add colorbars and titles. So the third sub-query should focus on these visualization aspects.

I need to make sure each sub-query is concise and only includes the relevant technical details without any extra information. Also, I should avoid including code or explanations, just the focused parts as per the user's instructions.
