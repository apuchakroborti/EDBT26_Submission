        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
        Create a script that performs the following steps:

1. Import necessary libraries: os, matplotlib, matplotlib.pyplot, numpy, mpl_toolkits.basemap, and h5py.

2. Define a constant FILE_NAME with the name of the HDF5 file to be processed.

3. Open the specified HDF5 file in read-only mode.

4. Extract datasets from the file:
   - `/RetrievalResults/xco2` for xCO2 data
   - `/SoundingGeometry/sounding_latitude_geoid` for latitude data
   - `/SoundingGeometry/sounding_longitude_geoid` for longitude data
   - `/SoundingGeometry/sounding_altitude` for altitude data
   - `/RetrievalHeader/sounding_time_tai93` for time data

5. Retrieve the 'Units' attribute from both xco2 and altitude datasets at index 0.

6. Create a figure with two subplots:
   - First subplot: Orthographic projection map with low resolution, centered at lat_0 = -55 and lon_0 = 120, displaying the sounding trajectory using latitude and longitude coordinates.
   - Second subplot: Line plot showing time vs xco2 data, with a twin axis for time vs altitude data.

7. Customize the map by adding:
   - Coastlines with a line width of 0.5
   - Parallels at latitudes [-80, 0, 20]
   - Meridians at longitudes [-180, 181, 20]

8. Customize both plots by setting appropriate axis labels, titles, and tick formats.

Okay, so I need to break down this user's query into three specific sub-queries. Let me start by understanding what the user is asking for.

The user wants a script that does several things: imports libraries, reads an HDF5 file, extracts datasets, retrieves attributes, and then visualizes data on two subplots. My task is to split this into three focused areas: HDF5 access, NumPy preprocessing, and plotting with visualization tools.

First, looking at the HDF5 part. The user needs to open the file in read-only mode using h5py. They're extracting specific datasets like xco2, latitude, longitude, altitude, and time. Also, they need to get the 'Units' attribute from xco2 and altitude datasets. So I should frame a sub-query that focuses on accessing these datasets and attributes with h5py.

Next, for NumPy preprocessing. The user might be dealing with data that has _FillValue, which often requires masking or replacing with NaNs. They might need to apply masks using np.where or masked_where. Also, they could compute min, max, or other stats. So the sub-query should cover handling these aspects.

Lastly, plotting and visualization. The user wants two subplots: a map and a line plot. For the map, they're using an orthographic projection with specific parameters. They need to add coastlines, parallels, meridians, etc., which are typical in Basemap or Cartopy. The line plot has time on the x-axis, xco2 and altitude on y, with twin axes. So the sub-query should focus on setting up these visualizations correctly.

I think I've covered all parts. Now, I'll structure each sub-query to be specific so that relevant documentation can be found easily.

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:  
How to use `h5py` to open an HDF5 file in read-only mode and access datasets at specific paths such as `/RetrievalResults/xco2`, `/SoundingGeometry/sounding_latitude_geoid`, `/SoundingGeometry/sounding_longitude_geoid`, `/SoundingGeometry/sounding_altitude`, and `/RetrievalHeader/sounding_time_tai93`. Also, how to retrieve the 'Units' attribute from datasets.

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:  
How to handle `_FillValue` in NumPy arrays, apply masks using `np.where` or `np.ma.masked_where`, and compute or filter data using preprocessing logic such as `min`, `max`.

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:  
How to use `matplotlib` and `mpl_toolkits.basemap` to create a figure with two subplots. The first subplot should be an orthographic projection map centered at specific latitudes and longitudes, displaying trajectories with coastlines, parallels, and meridians. The second subplot should be a line plot of time vs xco2 data with a twin axis for time vs altitude data, including customization of axis labels, titles, and tick formats.
