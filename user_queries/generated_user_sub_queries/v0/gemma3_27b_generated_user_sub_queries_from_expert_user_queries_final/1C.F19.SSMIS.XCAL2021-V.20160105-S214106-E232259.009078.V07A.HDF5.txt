"""
        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
        

Create a Python script that processes an HDF5 file and generates a geospatial plot as follows:

1. Import Libraries: Use os, matplotlib, matplotlib.pyplot, numpy, mpl_toolkits.basemap, and h5py.

2. Load Data: Open the HDF5 file "1C.F19.SSMIS.XCAL2021-V.20160105-S214106-E232259.009078.V07A.HDF5" in read-only mode using h5py.

3. Extract Dataset: Access the "/S1/Tc" dataset, which is 3D. Extract all data from the first and second dimensions at the 0th index of the third dimension. Retrieve attributes: 'units', 'LongName', and '_FillValue'.

4. Data Cleaning: Replace values matching _FillValue with NaN in the Tc dataset.

5. Geolocation Data: Read latitude from "/S1/Latitude" and longitude from "/S1/Longitude".

6. Map Setup: Create a cylindrical projection map with low resolution, latitude range -90 to 90, and longitude range -180 to 180. Add coastlines (width 0.5), parallels at [-90, 0, 90, 45], and meridians at [-180, 0, 180, 45] with labels [True, False, False, True].

7. Plot Data: Display Tc data as a scatter plot on the map using 'jet' colormap and point size 1.

8. Colorbar: Add a colorbar below the plot with 10% padding, labeled with the units from Tc's attributes.

9. Title: Set the title to include the file basename, Tc's LongName, and " (nchannel1=0)".

This structured approach ensures clarity for code generation by an LLM.

        """

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
How to open an HDF5 file with `h5py` in read-only mode, access a specific dataset by path (e.g., "/S1/Tc"), retrieve dataset attributes (e.g., 'units', 'LongName', '_FillValue'), and extract data from a multi-dimensional dataset at a specific index along one of its dimensions.

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
How to replace specific values (identified by `_FillValue`) with NaN in a NumPy array, and how to handle masked arrays using `np.ma.masked_where`.

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
How to create a cylindrical map projection using `mpl_toolkits.basemap` or `cartopy`, configure the map's latitude and longitude ranges, draw coastlines, parallels, and meridians, customize their appearance (e.g., width, labels), and display a scatter plot with a specified colormap and point size on the map. Also, how to add a colorbar below the plot with padding and a label, and set the plot title.
