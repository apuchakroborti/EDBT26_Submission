"""
        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
        Write Python code to read and visualize data from an HDF-EOS5 file located at HIRDLS-Aura_L2_v07-00-20-c01_2008d077.he5.

The code should:
1. Import necessary libraries: os, datetime, h5py, numpy as np, FormatStrFormatter and ScalarFormatter from matplotlib.ticker, matplotlib as mpl, matplotlib.pyplot as plt, and Basemap from mpl_toolkits.basemap.

2. Read three datasets:
   - O3 data from /HDFEOS/SWATHS/HIRDLS/Data Fields/O3 (extract 0th index along x-axis and all y-axis data)
   - Pressure data from /HDFEOS/SWATHS/HIRDLS/Geolocation Fields/Pressure
   - Time data from /HDFEOS/SWATHS/HIRDLS/Geolocation Fields/Time (only 0th index)

3. Read attributes:
   - Units from O3 and Pressure datasets
   - Title from O3, Time, and Pressure datasets
   - _FillValue from O3 dataset

4. Decode attribute values using decode().

5. Replace O3 data with NaN where it matches _FillValue.

6. Create datestr variable by initializing a datetime object at 1993-01-01 and adding seconds from the Time dataset.

7. Generate a plot of O3 vs Pressure:
   - Customize x-axis with scientific notation
   - Set y-axis to log scale and invert it
   - Format axis labels using dataset Titles and Units
   - Set title combining filename, O3 Title, and Units

8. Display the plot.

        Note: return only the the response of sub-queries only based on the below format, not explanation, not python code, and node additional text needed
        Return format:

        HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
        <generated sub-query>

        NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:

        Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:

        """

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
How to open an HDF5 file using `h5py`, access datasets by path (e.g., `/HDFEOS/SWATHS/HIRDLS/Data Fields/O3`), read dataset attributes (e.g., 'Units', 'Title', '_FillValue'), and decode attribute values using `.decode()`. Also, how to extract specific slices of data from a dataset (e.g., the 0th index along the x-axis and all y-axis data).

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
How to replace values in a NumPy array with NaN based on a `_FillValue`, and how to use NumPy for basic data manipulation and filtering.

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
How to create a plot using `matplotlib`, set the y-axis to a logarithmic scale and invert it, customize axis labels and titles, format the x-axis with scientific notation, and add a colorbar. Also, how to use `mpl_toolkits.basemap` or `cartopy` for geospatial plotting, including setting map projections and drawing coastlines.
