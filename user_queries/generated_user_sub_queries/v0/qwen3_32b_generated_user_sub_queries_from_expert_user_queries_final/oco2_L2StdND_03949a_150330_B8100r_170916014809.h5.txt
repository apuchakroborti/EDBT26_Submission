        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
        A Python script that reads an HDF5 file named `oco2_L2StdND_03949a_150330_B8100r_170916014809.h5` and generates a data visualization map. 
The script should perform the following steps:

1. Import Libraries: Include necessary libraries such as `os`, `datetime`, `h5py`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `matplotlib.pyplot`, and `mpl_toolkits.basemap.Basemap`.

2. Define Constants: Set the constant `FILE_NAME` to the specified HDF5 file name.

3. Open HDF5 File: Open the file in read-only mode and assign it to a variable `f`.

4. Read Data:
   - Extract data from `/RetrievalResults/xco2` into a variable named `data`.
   - Retrieve the units and description of this dataset.

5. Read Geolocation Data:
   - Read latitude values from `/RetrievalGeometry/retrieval_latitude` into a NumPy array called `latitude`.
   - Read longitude values from `/RetrievalGeometry/retrieval_longitude` into a NumPy array called `longitude`.

6. Set Up Map Projection:
   - Use a cylindrical projection with low resolution.
   - Define latitude and longitude ranges from -90 to 90 and -180 to 180, respectively.

7. Customize Map Features:
   - Add coastlines with a line width of 0.5.
   - Draw parallels using NumPy arange with values [-90, 91, 45] and meridians with values [-180, 180, 45], both at intervals of 45 degrees.
   - Label the map with `labels=[True, False, False, True]`.

8. Create Scatter Plot:
   - Use the scatter function with parameters: longitude (`lon`), latitude (`lat`), data (`c=data`), marker size (`s=1`), colormap (`cmap=plt.cm.jet`), and no edge colors or line width.

9. Add Colorbar and Labels:
   - Include a colorbar at the bottom of the plot with format `%.1e` and 10% padding.
   - Set the label for the data using the retrieved units.

10. Display Plot: Render the final visualization.

Okay, let's tackle this user query. The user wants a Python script that reads an HDF5 file and generates a data visualization map. They've outlined specific steps, so I need to break it down into the three required sub-queries.

First, the HDF5 Dataset Access part. The user mentions using h5py to open the file and access datasets like /RetrievalResults/xco2. I need to focus on how to open the file with h5py, read the dataset, and retrieve its attributes like units and description. Also, the geolocation data paths are specified, so I should include those in the sub-query.

Next, the NumPy-based Data Preprocessing. The user wants to handle _FillValue, which is common in HDF5 datasets. They might need to mask those values using NumPy functions like np.ma.masked_where. Also, they might need to filter data based on min and max, but the user hasn't specified exact values, so the sub-query should be general enough to cover applying masks and handling fill values.

For the Plotting and Visualization part, the user is using Basemap with a cylindrical projection. They need to set up the map, add coastlines, draw parallels and meridians at specific intervals, and create a scatter plot with a colorbar. The sub-query should focus on using Basemap's methods for projection, drawing features, and matplotlib's scatter and colorbar functions. Also, the label configuration and colormap are important here.

I need to make sure each sub-query is specific to its domain. For example, the HDF5 sub-query should only mention h5py and dataset paths, not the plotting. Similarly, the NumPy part should focus on data handling without mentioning map projections. The visualization sub-query should detail the plotting libraries and their specific functions without going into data preprocessing steps.

Let me check the user's steps again to ensure I didn't miss anything. They mentioned reading data and geolocation, setting up the map projection, customizing features like coastlines and labels, creating a scatter plot with specific parameters, adding a colorbar, and displaying the plot. Each of these steps maps to one of the three sub-queries. I need to make sure each sub-query captures the relevant parts without overlap.

Also, the user wants the sub-queries to be in a specific format, so I need to structure them correctly without any explanations or code. Just the technical questions or instructions for each domain. Let me make sure each sub-query is concise and targets the right technical area.

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
How to use h5py to open an HDF5 file named `oco2_L2StdND_03949a_150330_B8100r_170916014809.h5` in read-only mode, extract datasets at paths `/RetrievalResults/xco2`, `/RetrievalGeometry/retrieval_latitude`, and `/RetrievalGeometry/retrieval_longitude`, and retrieve metadata attributes like units and description from the `/RetrievalResults/xco2` dataset.

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
How to handle `_FillValue` attributes in NumPy arrays for datasets like `data`, `latitude`, and `longitude`, apply masking using `np.ma.masked_where` or `np.where` to filter invalid values, and ensure data ranges align with visualization requirements using `min`/`max` logic if needed.

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
How to use `mpl_toolkits.basemap.Basemap` to create a cylindrical projection map with low resolution, latitude/longitude ranges (-90 to 90, -180 to 180), add coastlines (linewidth=0.5), draw parallels/meridians at 45° intervals with labels on the left and bottom, generate a scatter plot with `c=data`, `s=1`, `cmap=plt.cm.jet`, and add a bottom-aligned colorbar with `%.1e` formatting and 10% padding.
