        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
        A Python script that accesses and visualizes ozone data from a NASA HDF-EOS file named `DSCOVR_EPIC_L2_TO3_03_20210301005516_03.h5`. 
The script should perform the following steps:

1. Import necessary libraries: os, cartopy.crs, matplotlib, matplotlib.pyplot, numpy, mpl_toolkits.basemap, h5py, 
   and LATITUDE_FORMATTER and LONGITUDE_FORMATTER from cartopy.mpl.gridlines.

2. Open the HDF5 file in read-only mode and extract the following datasets:
   - `/Ozone` for ozone data
   - `/Latitude` for latitude coordinates
   - `/Longitude` for longitude coordinates

3. Set attributes such as `units` (expected value: 'DU') and `long_name` (expected value: 'Ozone').

4. Process the ozone data by replacing the static fill value (-999.0) with NaN values using numpy's masked_where function, based on whether the ozone data is not a number.

5. Calculate the midpoint of the latitude and longitude arrays to determine the center point for visualization.

6. Create an orthographic projection map centered at the calculated midpoint using Cartopy's Orthographic class.

7. Plot the ozone data as a scatter plot with parameters:
   - Longitude as x-coordinates
   - Latitude as y-coordinates
   - Ozone values represented by color (using cmap=plt.cm.jet)
   - Marker size of 1
   - Data transformation set to PlateCarree coordinates

8. Add map features including gridlines, coastlines, and degree labels for latitude and longitude.

9. Create a colorbar with a width of 0.022 and padding of 0.01.

Okay, let's tackle this user query. The user wants a Python script that accesses and visualizes ozone data from an HDF-EOS file. They've outlined specific steps, so I need to break it down into the three required sub-queries.

First, the HDF5 Dataset Access part. The user mentions using h5py to open the file and extract datasets like /Ozone, /Latitude, and /Longitude. They also want to set attributes like units and long_name. So the sub-query should focus on how to access these datasets with h5py, retrieve their attributes, and handle the file correctly. I need to make sure to mention the specific paths and the expected attributes.

Next, the NumPy-based Data Preprocessing. The user wants to replace the fill value (-999.0) with NaN using numpy's masked_where. The sub-query here should detail how to apply the mask, check for the fill value, and handle the data array. Also, mention the use of numpy functions for processing, like checking if values are not a number, but since the fill value is a static number, maybe it's just checking for equality with -999.0.

For the Plotting and Visualization part, the user is using Cartopy's Orthographic projection. The sub-query needs to cover creating the projection, setting the center point, plotting the scatter with PlateCarree coordinates, adding coastlines, gridlines with Cartopy's formatters, and the colorbar. Also, mention the specific parameters like cmap, marker size, and the colorbar's width and padding.

I need to ensure each sub-query is focused on its respective domain without overlapping. Avoid any code examples, just the technical aspects relevant to each library. Check that all the user's steps are covered in the sub-queries, and use the correct terminology for each part. Make sure the HDF5 part is about accessing the datasets and attributes, the NumPy part is about masking and preprocessing, and the visualization part is about Cartopy and matplotlib specifics.

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
How to replace a static fill value (-999.0) in a NumPy array with NaN using `np.ma.masked_where`, based on a condition checking for equality with the fill value, while preserving valid ozone data values.

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
How to create an orthographic projection map with Cartopy's `Orthographic` class, plot geospatial scatter points using PlateCarree coordinates, add coastlines, gridlines with Cartopy formatters, and configure a colorbar with specified width and padding using matplotlib and Cartopy.
