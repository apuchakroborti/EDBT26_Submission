        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
        A Python script to visualize ozone (O3) data from an HDF5 file with the following specifications:

1. Import Libraries: Include os, h5py, numpy as np, matplotlib as mpl, matplotlib.pyplot as plt, and Basemap from mpl_toolkits.basemap.

2. Load Data:
   - Open the HDF5 file: 'TES-Aura_L2-O3-Nadir_r0000002433_F08_12.he5'.
   - Extract ozone data from '/HDFEOS/SWATHS/O3NadirSwath/Data Fields/O3' (all rows, 6th column).
   - Retrieve latitude and longitude from their respective paths.

3. Data Processing:
   - Extract Units, Title, and FillValue attributes from the O3 dataset.
   - Replace FillValues with NaNs in the ozone data.

4. Create Map:
   - Use Basemap with cylindrical projection, low resolution, lat limits [-90, 90], lon limits [-180, 180].
   - Draw coastlines (linewidth=0.5), parallels (every 45 degrees) from -90 to 90, 
      and meridians (every 45 degrees with labels on left and right) from -180 to 180.

5. Plot Data:
   - Scatter plot ozone data using longitude, latitude coordinates; set marker size to 1.

6. Customize Plot:
   - Add colorbar labeled with O3 Units.
   - Set title combining HDF5 filename base and O3 long_name attribute.

Okay, let's tackle this user query. The user wants a Python script to visualize ozone data from an HDF5 file. They've provided specific steps, so I need to break it down into the three required sub-queries.

First, the HDF5 Dataset Access part. The user mentions using h5py to open an HE5 file. The dataset path is '/HDFEOS/SWATHS/O3NadirSwath/Data Fields/O3', and they need to extract the 6th column. Also, they need to get attributes like Units, Title, and FillValue. So the sub-query should focus on accessing the HDF5 file with h5py, extracting specific datasets by path, and retrieving attributes.

Next, the NumPy-based Data Preprocessing. The user wants to replace FillValues with NaNs. They mentioned using _FillValue and functions like np.where or np.ma.masked_where. The sub-query here should be about handling FillValues and applying masks in NumPy.

Lastly, the Map Plotting and Visualization. They're using Basemap with cylindrical projection, setting lat/lon limits, drawing coastlines, parallels, meridians. The scatter plot with longitude and latitude, colorbar with units, and title combining filename and attribute. The sub-query needs to focus on Basemap setup, plotting with scatter, adding colorbar and title.

I need to make sure each sub-query is specific to its domain. For HDF5, it's about accessing the file and datasets. For NumPy, handling FillValues. For plotting, using Basemap's features. Avoid mixing domains. Also, check the user's note to return only the sub-queries without explanations or code. Keep each sub-query concise and targeted.

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
How to open an HDF5 file with h5py, access datasets at specific paths like '/HDFEOS/SWATHS/O3NadirSwath/Data Fields/O3', extract attributes (Units, Title, FillValue), and retrieve specific columns (e.g., 6th column) from datasets.

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
How to replace _FillValue in NumPy arrays with NaNs using np.where or np.ma.masked_where, and handle missing data in ozone datasets.

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
How to use Basemap with cylindrical projection to create a global map (-90 to 90 lat, -180 to 180 lon), draw coastlines, parallels (every 45°), meridians (every 45° with left/right labels), scatter plot geospatial data with longitude/latitude coordinates, add a colorbar with units, and set a title combining filename and dataset attributes.
