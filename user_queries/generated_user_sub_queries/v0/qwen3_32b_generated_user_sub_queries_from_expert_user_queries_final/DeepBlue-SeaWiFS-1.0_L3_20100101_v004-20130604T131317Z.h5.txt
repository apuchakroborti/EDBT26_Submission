        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
        A Python script that performs the following tasks:

1. Import necessary libraries: os, h5py, matplotlib, matplotlib.pyplot, mpl_toolkits.basemap, numpy.

2. Read data from an HDF5 file named "DeepBlue-SeaWiFS-1.0_L3_20100101_v004-20130604T131317Z.h5".

3. Extract the following datasets:
   - aerosol_optical_thickness_550_ocean
   - latitude
   - longitude

4. Retrieve attributes from the aerosol_optical_thickness_550_ocean dataset:
   - long_name
   - _FillValue

5. Decode the long_name attribute using the decode() function.

6. Replace all data points matching _FillValue with NaN values in the aerosol_optical_thickness_550_ocean dataset.

7. Create a masked array of the aerosol_optical_thickness_550_ocean data where NaN values are masked.

8. Generate a cylindrical projection map with:
   - Low resolution
   - Latitude range from -90 to 90
   - Longitude range from -180 to 180

9. Add map features:
   - Coastlines with line width 0.5
   - Parallels at latitudes at [-90, -60, -30, 0, 30, 60, 90, 120]
   - Meridians at longitudes at [-180, -135, -90, -45, 0, 45, 90, 135, 180]

10. Create a pcolormesh plot of the masked aerosol data on the map:
    - Use longitude and latitude coordinates
    - Set color scale from 0 to 1 (vmin=0, vmax=1)
    - Ensure latlon=True for geographic projection

11. Add a colorbar to the plot.

Okay, let's tackle this user query. The user wants a Python script that does several things with an HDF5 file and then plots the data. I need to break this down into three sub-queries as specified.

First, the HDF5 Dataset Access part. The user is using h5py to read an HDF5 file. They need to extract specific datasets and attributes. So the sub-query should focus on how to open the file with h5py, access the datasets by their paths, and retrieve attributes like long_name and _FillValue. Also, the file has a specific name, so that should be included. The decode() function is mentioned for the long_name, so maybe that's part of the attribute retrieval.

Next, the NumPy-based Data Preprocessing. The user wants to replace _FillValue with NaN and create a masked array. The sub-query here should cover handling _FillValue using NumPy functions like np.where or np.ma.masked_where. Also, the process of replacing those values and masking them. The user mentioned using min and max, but in this case, it's about replacing specific values, so the focus is on those functions.

For the Plotting and Visualization part, the user is using matplotlib and basemap. They need a cylindrical projection with specific latitude and longitude ranges. The sub-query should address creating the map with low resolution, setting the lat/lon ranges, adding coastlines, parallels, meridians, and using pcolormesh with the correct parameters. Also, the colorbar and title. Since they mentioned mpl_toolkits.basemap, the sub-query should include how to configure the projection and draw those elements.

I need to make sure each sub-query is specific to its domain. No overlapping. For example, the HDF5 part shouldn't mention plotting, and the preprocessing part shouldn't talk about projections. Also, the user's note says to return only the sub-queries without explanations or code, so I have to be concise and precise.

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
How to use h5py to open an HDF5 file with .h5 extension, extract datasets "aerosol_optical_thickness_550_ocean", "latitude", and "longitude", retrieve attributes "long_name" and "_FillValue" from the aerosol dataset, and decode the long_name attribute using decode() function.

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
How to replace _FillValue with NaN in a NumPy array using np.where or np.ma.masked_where, create a masked array for aerosol_optical_thickness_550_ocean data, and apply min/max filtering if required.

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
How to use matplotlib and basemap to create a cylindrical projection map with low resolution, latitude range -90-90, longitude range -180-180, add coastlines (linewidth=0.5), draw parallels at [-90,-60,-30,0,30,60,90,120], meridians at [-180,-135,-90,-45,0,45,90,135,180], generate pcolormesh with lat/lon coordinates (vmin=0, vmax=1, latlon=True), and add a colorbar.
