"""
        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
        A Python script that processes and visualizes ozone profile data from an HDF5 file by following these steps:

1. Import Libraries: Include necessary libraries such as os, datetime, h5py, numpy (as np), matplotlib (as mpl), matplotlib.pyplot (as plt), FormatStrFormatter from matplotlib.ticker, and Basemap from mpl_toolkits.basemap.

2. Define Constants: Set the FILE_NAME constant to the path of the HDF5 file: "SBUV2-NOAA17_L2-SBUV2N17L2_2011m1231_v01-02-2013m0828t143157.h5".

3. Read Data: Open the HDF5 file and extract datasets:
   - `/SCIENCE_DATA/ProfileO3Retrieved` for 2D ozone profiles.
   - `/GEOLOCATION_DATA/Latitude` for 1D latitude values.
   - `/ANCILLARY_DATA/PressureLevels` for 1D pressure levels.
   - `nTimes` for time in seconds since 1993-01-01.

4. Access Attributes: Retrieve attributes like units, valid_min, valid_max, _FillValue, and long_name. Decode these attributes using the decode function.

5. Process Data:
   - Replace invalid ozone values (below valid_min, above valid_max, or equal to _FillValue) with NaN.
   - Create a masked array using the ozone data and NaN conditions.

6. Sort and Convert:
   - Sort latitude values in ascending order.
   - Convert time values from seconds to datetime objects.

7. Plot Data: Generate a contour plot with latitude on the x-axis and pressure levels on the y-axis, using ozone data for color mapping. Label the colorbar with ozone units.

8. Customize Plot:
   - Set axis labels and add a title.
   - Annotate the plot with start and end times.
   - Invert the y-axis, apply a log scale, and remove scientific notation from tick labels.

Okay, let's tackle this user query. The user wants a Python script that processes and visualizes ozone data from an HDF5 file. They've outlined specific steps, so I need to break it down into the three required sub-queries.

First, the HDF5 Dataset Access part. The user is using h5py, so I need to focus on how to open the file and extract the datasets mentioned. The datasets are /SCIENCE_DATA/ProfileO3Retrieved, /GEOLOCATION_DATA/Latitude, /ANCILLARY_DATA/PressureLevels, and nTimes. Also, they need to access attributes like units, valid_min, etc. So the sub-query should ask about using h5py to access these datasets and their attributes, including decoding them. Maybe mention the file path and the specific dataset paths.

Next, the NumPy-based Data Preprocessing. The user wants to replace invalid ozone values (below valid_min, above valid_max, or equal to _FillValue) with NaN and create a masked array. So the sub-query should focus on handling _FillValue, applying masks with np.ma.masked_where or np.where, and using min/max to filter data. Also, converting time from seconds to datetime is part of preprocessing, but that might be more about datetime handling. Wait, the user's step 6 is sorting latitude and converting time, but the NumPy sub-query is about data preprocessing. The time conversion might be in another part, but the user's step 5 is about replacing invalid values. So the sub-query should ask about replacing invalid values with NaN using NumPy functions and creating masked arrays.

Third, the Plotting and Visualization. The user wants a contour plot with latitude on x-axis and pressure on y, using ozone data. They need to use matplotlib, Basemap, or cartopy. The sub-query should ask about creating a contour plot with those libraries, setting projections, adding coastlines, meridians, colorbars, and customizing labels and titles. Also, inverting the y-axis, log scale, and removing scientific notation. So the sub-query should focus on using matplotlib and Basemap for the plot, configuring the projection, and applying those customizations.

I need to make sure each sub-query is specific to its domain. For HDF5, it's about accessing datasets and attributes with h5py. For NumPy, it's about data preprocessing steps like masking and replacing values. For plotting, it's about using matplotlib and Basemap to create the contour plot with specific customizations. Also, check if the user mentioned any specific functions or parameters that should be included in the sub-queries. For example, the decode function for attributes, but that's part of the HDF5 access. The time conversion is part of preprocessing? Wait, step 6 says converting time from seconds to datetime. That's more about datetime handling, but the user's step 5 is about data preprocessing. Maybe the time conversion is part of the data processing, but the user's step 5 is about ozone data. So the time conversion might be in another part, but the NumPy sub-query is about handling _FillValue and masks. So the time conversion is probably handled in a different step, maybe not part of the NumPy preprocessing here. The user's step 6 is sorting latitude and converting time, but the NumPy sub-query is about data preprocessing. So maybe the time conversion is part of another sub-query, but the user hasn't specified. The user's step 5 is about ozone data, so the NumPy sub-query should focus on that. The time conversion is part of the data processing but might be handled in a different way, perhaps using datetime module, but the user's step 6 is part of the process. However, the user's instruction says to focus on the three sub-queries as given. So the NumPy sub-query is about handling _FillValue, valid_min, valid_max, and creating masked arrays. The time conversion is part of the data processing but not covered in the NumPy sub-query. The user's step 6 is part of the data processing, but the NumPy sub-query is about data preprocessing. So maybe the time conversion is part of another step, but the user's step 6 is included in the process. However, the user's instruction says to focus on the three sub-queries. So the time conversion is probably not part of the NumPy sub-query. The user's step 5 is about ozone data, so the NumPy sub-query should focus on that.
