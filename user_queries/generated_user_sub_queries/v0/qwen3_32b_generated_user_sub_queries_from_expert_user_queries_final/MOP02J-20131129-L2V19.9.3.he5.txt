"""
        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
        File Input and Constants
- Specify the input file as `MOP02J-20131129-L2V19.9.3.he5` stored in the constant `FILE_NAME`.
- Import necessary libraries: `os`, `datetime`, `h5py`, `numpy` as `np`, `matplotlib` as `mpl`, `matplotlib.pyplot` as `plt`, and `mpl_toolkits.basemap.Basemap`.

Extracting Data
- Extract data from the HDF5 dataset at `/HDFEOS/SWATHS/MOP02/Data Fields/RetrievedSurfaceTemperature`.
- Read the first column of this dataset into an array named `data`.
- Retrieve the `units` and `_FillValue` attributes associated with the RetrievedSurfaceTemperaturehis dataset.
- Decode the `units` string using the `decode()` function.

Data Preprocessing and Cleaning
- Replace values in `data` that match `_FillValue` with `numpy.nan`.

Extracting Geolocation Data
- Extract latitude data from `/HDFEOS/SWATHS/MOP02/Geolocation Fields/Latitude`.
- Extract longitude data from `/HDFEOS/SWATHS/MOP02/Geolocation Fields/Longitude`.

Creating a Map
- Add coastlines with a line width of 0.5.
- Draw parallels using `numpy.arange(-90, 91, 45)`.
- Draw meridians using `numpy.arange(-180, 180, 45)` and set labels to `[True, False, False, True]`.

Scatter Plot Configuration
- Use the `scatter` function with parameters: longitude, latitude, `c=data`, marker size `s=1`, colormap `plt.cm.jet`, no edge colors (`edgecolors=None`), and line width `linewidth=0`.

Customizing the Map
- Add a colorbar to represent data units.
- Set the colorbar label using the decoded `units` value.

Okay, let's tackle this user query. The user wants to break down their task into three specific sub-queries for HDF5 access, NumPy preprocessing, and visualization. 

First, for the HDF5 part. The user is working with an HE5 file, so I need to focus on using h5py to access datasets. They mentioned the path /HDFEOS/SWATHS/MOP02/Data Fields/RetrievedSurfaceTemperature and need to read the first column. Also, they want to get the units and _FillValue attributes. So the sub-query should ask about accessing datasets, reading specific columns, and retrieving attributes.

Next, the NumPy preprocessing. The user wants to replace _FillValue with NaN. They mentioned using functions like np.where or np.ma.masked_where. The sub-query here should focus on handling _FillValue and replacing it with NaN using NumPy methods.

Lastly, the visualization part. They're using Basemap to create a map with coastlines, parallels, meridians, and a scatter plot. The sub-query needs to cover setting up the map projection, drawing coastlines, adding parallels and meridians with specific intervals, and configuring the scatter plot with colorbar and labels. Also, using the decoded units for the colorbar label.

I need to make sure each sub-query is focused on its respective domain without overlapping. Avoid mentioning code, just the technical aspects. Check the user's note to return only the sub-queries in the specified format.

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
How to use h5py to open an HE5 file, access datasets at specific paths like `/HDFEOS/SWATHS/MOP02/Data Fields/RetrievedSurfaceTemperature`, read the first column of a dataset, and retrieve attributes such as `units` and `_FillValue` from the dataset.

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
How to replace values in a NumPy array matching a specific `_FillValue` with `numpy.nan` using functions like `np.where` or `np.ma.masked_where` for data cleaning.

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
How to use `mpl_toolkits.basemap.Basemap` to create a map projection, draw coastlines with a specified line width, add labeled parallels and meridians with custom intervals, and generate a scatter plot with colormap, colorbar, and title using `matplotlib.pyplot`.
