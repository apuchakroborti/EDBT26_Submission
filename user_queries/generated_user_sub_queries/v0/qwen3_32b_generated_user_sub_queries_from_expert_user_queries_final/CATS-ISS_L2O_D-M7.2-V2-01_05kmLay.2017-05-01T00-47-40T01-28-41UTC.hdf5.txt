        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
        1. Load an HDF5 file named 'CATS-ISS_L2O_D-M7.2-V2-01_05kmLay.2017-05-01T00-47-40T01-28-41UTC.hdf5' in read-only mode using h5py.

2. Import necessary libraries: datetime, os, matplotlib (including pyplot and toolkits), numpy, sys, time, and colors.

3. Access the following datasets from the HDF5 file:
   - '/layer_descriptor/Aerosol_Type_Fore_FOV' as a 2D array for aerosol type information.
   - '/geolocation/CATS_Fore_FOV_Latitude' and '/geolocation/CATS_Fore_FOV_Longitude' as 2D arrays for latitude and longitude values.

4. Extract the first column from the Aerosol_Type_Fore_FOV dataset, the second column from the latitude data, and the second column from the longitude data.

5. Create a discrete color map named 'cmap' with nine colors: "grey", "blue", "aqua", "yellow", "orange", "green", "red", "black", and "brown".

6. Set up a geographic map using a cylindrical projection with low resolution, latitude range from -90 to 90, longitude range from -180 to 180, 
   coastlines with linewidth 0.5, parallels at [-90, 0, 45, 60, 75, 90], and meridians at [-180, -120, -60, 0, 60, 120, 180] with labels [True, False, False, True].

7. Create a scatter plot using longitude and latitude data with parameters: c=data, s=0.1, cmap='jet', edgecolors=None, linewidth=0.

8. Set the plot title to the basename of the HDF5 file.

9. Define bins for the colorbar using numpy.linspace(0, 9, 10) and normalize using matplotlib.colors.BoundaryNorm with bounds and N=9.

10. Create a second axes object (ax2) at position [0.1, 0.1, 0.8, 0.02] and add a horizontal colorbar with parameters: ax=ax2, cmap=cmap, normalize=normalize, orientation='horizontal', spacing='proportional', ticks=bounds, boundaries=bounds, format='%1i'.

11. Set x-tick labels for the colorbar as ["invalid", "marine", "p. marine", "dust", "dust mixture", "clean/bg", "p. continental", "smoke", "volcanic"] with font size 5.

Okay, let's tackle this user query step by step. The user wants to break down their data science task into three specific sub-queries for different technical domains. 

First, the HDF5 Dataset Access part. The user is using h5py to load an HDF5 file. They need to access specific datasets and their attributes. The sub-query should focus on how to open the file in read-only mode, access the datasets by their paths, and retrieve metadata. I need to mention the exact dataset paths they're using, like '/layer_descriptor/Aerosol_Type_Fore_FOV' and the geolocation datasets. Also, the file extension is .hdf5, so that's important to include.

Next, the NumPy-based Data Preprocessing. The user is extracting specific columns from the datasets. They mentioned the first column of Aerosol_Type and the second columns of latitude and longitude. The sub-query should address how to handle _FillValue (though the user didn't specify it here, maybe it's part of the dataset's metadata), apply masks if necessary, and extract those columns. Since they're using NumPy functions like where or masked_where, I should focus on column extraction and any preprocessing steps like filtering or computing min/max if needed. But in the user's case, it's just column extraction, so the sub-query should reflect that.

For the Plotting and Visualization part, the user is using matplotlib and basemap. They want a cylindrical projection with specific latitude and longitude ranges, coastlines, and meridians/parallels. The color map is discrete with nine colors, and they need a colorbar with specific formatting. The sub-query should cover setting up the projection, drawing coastlines, configuring the colorbar with the defined bins and normalization, and placing the colorbar correctly. Also, the scatter plot parameters like c, s, cmap, etc., need to be addressed in the visualization context.

I need to make sure each sub-query is focused on its respective domain without overlapping. The HDF5 part is about accessing data, NumPy is about preprocessing (even if it's just column extraction here), and the visualization is about plotting and colorbar setup. Also, the user mentioned using specific libraries like datetime, os, etc., but those are part of the imports and not directly relevant to the sub-queries, so I can ignore them in the sub-queries. 

Wait, the user's step 4 is extracting columns. For the NumPy sub-query, that's about handling data, so extracting columns using NumPy. The user didn't mention _FillValue in their query, but the instruction says to focus on handling _FillValue and masks. Since the user's data might have _FillValue, maybe the sub-query should include checking for that and applying masks. But the user's step 4 doesn't mention it, so perhaps it's implied. The sub-query should still address how to handle _FillValue if present, apply masks, and extract columns. 

In the visualization sub-query, the user is creating a discrete color map with nine colors. The sub-query should focus on creating the color map, setting up the projection, drawing coastlines, meridians, parallels, and the colorbar with the specified parameters. Also, the colorbar's ticks and labels need to be addressed here.

I need to structure each sub-query clearly, using the exact terms from the user's query and the specified domains. Make sure each sub-query is a question or a statement that targets the specific technical aspect without any code or explanations.
