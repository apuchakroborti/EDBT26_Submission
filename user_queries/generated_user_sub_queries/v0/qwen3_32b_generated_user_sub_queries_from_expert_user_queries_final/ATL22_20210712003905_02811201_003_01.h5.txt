"""
        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
        1. Import Necessary Libraries:  
   Import the required libraries for handling operating system functions, creating visualizations, numerical computations, map projections, and working with HDF5 files: `os`, `matplotlib`, `matplotlib.pyplot`, `numpy`, and `mpl_toolkits.basemap`.

2. Define Constants:  
   Define a constant `FILE_NAME` with the value `'ATL22_20210712003905_02811201_003_01.h5'`, which specifies the HDF5 file to be processed.

3. Open the HDF5 File and Access Datasets:  
   Open the HDF5 file in read mode and access the following datasets:  
   - `/gt1l/transect_lat` for latitude data.  
   - `/gt1l/transect_lon` for longitude data.  
   - `/gt1l/inland_water_body_type` for the main data.  

   Read the attributes `units`, `long_name` (decoded using `decode('ascii', 'replace')`), and `_FillValue` from the inland_water_body_type dataset.

4. Data Processing and Cleaning:  
   Convert the main data to a float type using `.astype(float)`. Replace the `_FillValue` with `numpy.NaN` and mask the data using `numpy.ma.masked_where(numpy.isnan(data), data)`.

5. Create a Map:  
   Create an equidistant cylindrical projection map with low resolution, setting latitude and longitude bounds from -90 to 90 and -180 to 180, respectively. 
   Add coastlines with a line width of 0.5, parallels at intervals of [-90, -60, -30, 0, 30, 60, 90], and meridians at intervals of [-180, -135, -90, -45, 0, 45, 90, 135, 180].

6. Scatter Plot:  
   Use the `scatter` function to plot the data on the map with parameters: longitude, latitude, `c=data`, marker size `s=0.1`, colormap `plt.cm.jet`, and no edge colors or linewidth.

7. Add Colorbar and Title:  
   Add a colorbar to the map, positioned at the bottom, labeled with the main dataset's `units`. 
   Set the title of the plot to include the file basename, dataset path name, and `long_name` from the attributes.

Okay, let's tackle this user query. The user wants to break down their task into three specific sub-queries for HDF5 access, NumPy preprocessing, and plotting. 

First, for the HDF5 part. They mentioned using h5py to open an HDF5 file and access specific datasets like /gt1l/transect_lat. I need to focus on how to open the file, access those datasets, and read attributes like units and _FillValue. The sub-query should ask about accessing datasets with h5py, reading attributes, and handling dataset paths.

Next, the NumPy preprocessing. The user converts data to float, replaces _FillValue with NaN, and masks it. The sub-query here should be about handling _FillValue, converting data types, and using masked arrays. They use np.where or np.ma.masked_where, so the question should target those functions and replacing fill values with NaN.

Lastly, the plotting. They use Basemap for an equidistant cylindrical projection, add coastlines, parallels, meridians, and a colorbar. The sub-query needs to focus on creating the map with specific projections, adding elements like coastlines, and configuring colorbars and titles. Mentioning matplotlib, Basemap, and Cartopy is important here.

I need to make sure each sub-query is distinct and only covers its respective domain. No overlap between them. Also, avoid any code examples or explanations, just the technical questions. Let me check the user's note again to confirm the format. Yes, only the sub-queries in the specified format without any extra text.
</think>

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
How to use h5py to open an HDF5 file with .h5 extension, access datasets at paths like '/gt1l/transect_lat', read attributes such as 'units', 'long_name' (with ASCII decoding), and '_FillValue' from a dataset, and handle nested dataset structures in HDF5 files.

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
How to convert a NumPy array to float type, replace specific _FillValue with NaN, and create a masked array using np.ma.masked_where based on NaN values for data filtering and preprocessing.

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
How to create an equidistant cylindrical projection map using Basemap with longitude/latitude bounds (-180 to 180, -90 to 90), add coastlines, draw parallels/meridians at specified intervals, plot geospatial scatter points with colormap, and add a bottom-aligned colorbar with units and a dynamic title using matplotlib.
