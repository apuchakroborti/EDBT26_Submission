        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
        1. Import Necessary Libraries: Include libraries for OS functions (os), plotting (matplotlib, matplotlib.pyplot), numerical operations (numpy), map projections (mpl_toolkits.basemap), and HDF5 handling.

2. Define Constants: Set `FILE_NAME` to "ATL20-01_20181101001332_05100101_004_01.h5".

3. Open HDF5 File: Access the file in read mode and extract datasets `/grid_lat`, `/grid_lon`, and `/monthly/mean_fb`.

4. Extract Attributes: From the mean_fb dataset, decode 'units' and 'long_name' using ASCII with replace errors, and retrieve '_FillValue'.

5. Data Processing:
   - Convert mean_fb data to float.
   - Replace _FillValue with NaN.
   - Mask data where values are NaN.

6. Create Map Projection: Use npstere with low resolution, boundinglat=60, lon_0=45.

7. Customize Map:
   - Add coastlines (linewidth=0.5).
   - Draw parallels at [-90, 120, 30] to be more specific from -90 to 120 with interval of 30.
   - Draw meridians at [-180, 180, 45] to be be more specific from -180 to 180 with interval of 45.

8. Adjust Longitude: 
   Before setting pcolormesh the 180 should be subtractted from longitude value and update the longitude existing value 
   Then it adds pcolormesh with parameters longitude, latitude, data, and latlon=True

9. Add Colorbar and Title:
    - Position colorbar at the bottom, labeled with dataset units.
    - Set title using file basename and 'long_name' attribute.

Okay, let's tackle this user query step by step. The user wants to break down their data science task into three specific sub-queries for different technical domains. 

First, the HDF5 Dataset Access part. The user is using h5py to open an HDF5 file and extract specific datasets. I need to focus on how to access the file with the given extensions and paths. The datasets mentioned are /grid_lat, /grid_lon, and /monthly/mean_fb. Also, they need to extract attributes like units, long_name, and _FillValue from the mean_fb dataset. So the sub-query should ask about accessing these datasets and their attributes using h5py.

Next, the NumPy-based Data Preprocessing. The user wants to convert mean_fb data to float, replace _FillValue with NaN, and mask the data. The key here is handling _FillValue with NumPy functions like np.where or np.ma.masked_where. The sub-query should focus on how to apply these operations, specifically replacing the fill value and masking NaNs.

For the Map Plotting and Visualization, the user is using Basemap with a npstere projection, adding coastlines, drawing parallels and meridians at specific intervals, adjusting longitude by subtracting 180, and adding a colorbar and title. The sub-query needs to address using Basemap or Cartopy for the projection, drawing elements like coastlines, setting up the pcolormesh with adjusted longitude, and adding the colorbar and title. Since the user mentioned mpl_toolkits.basemap, I should focus on that library's functions for the map setup.

I need to make sure each sub-query is specific to its domain without overlapping. Also, the user wants only the sub-queries in the specified format, no explanations or code. Let me structure each part clearly, using the exact terms from the user's query to ensure the vector database can retrieve the right information.
</think>

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
How to use h5py to open an HDF5 file with .h5 extension, extract datasets at paths /grid_lat, /grid_lon, and /monthly/mean_fb, and retrieve attributes 'units', 'long_name', and '_FillValue' from the mean_fb dataset using ASCII decoding with error replacement?

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
How to convert a NumPy array to float type, replace specific _FillValue with NaN, and apply a mask to exclude NaN values using np.where or np.ma.masked_where for data preprocessing?

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
How to create a polar stereographic (npstere) map projection with mpl_toolkits.basemap, set boundinglat=60 and lon_0=45, draw coastlines (linewidth=0.5), add parallels at [-90, 120, 30] and meridians at [-180, 180, 45], adjust longitude values by subtracting 180 before plotting with pcolormesh (latlon=True), and add a bottom-positioned colorbar with dataset units and a title combining file basename and long_name attribute?
