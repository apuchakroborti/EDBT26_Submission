        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
        A Python script that processes an HDF5 file containing geospatial data. The script should follow these steps:

1. Import Necessary Libraries: Include libraries for OS operations (os), plotting (matplotlib and matplotlib.pyplot), 
numerical computations (numpy), map projections (mpl_toolkits.basemap), and handling HDF5 files.

2. Define Constants: Set a constant `FILE_NAME` to the path "ICESat_2/ATL11_051911_0321_006_06.h5".

3. Open and Read HDF5 File: 
Open the file in read mode and access the datasets `/pt1/latitude`, `/pt1/longitude`, and `/pt1/h_corr`. 
Extract attributes `units` and `long_name` using decoding with 'ascii' and 'replace', and retrieve `_FillValue` from the h_corr dataset.

4. Data Preprocessing:
   - Convert h_corr data to float.
   - Replace `_FillValue` with numpy NaN.
   - Mask data where values are NaN.

5. Create Map Projection: Use an equidistant cylindrical projection with low resolution, setting latitude from -90 to 90 and longitude from -180 to 180.

6. Customize Map:
   - Add coastlines with a line width of 0.5.
   - Draw parallels at intervals of 30 degrees starting from -90 till 120.
   - Draw meridians every 45 degrees from -180 to 180.

7. Generate Scatter Plot: Create a scatter plot using longitude and latitude coordinates, with data as the color variable. Use a marker size of 0.1, jet colormap, no edge colors, and no line widths.

8. Add Colorbar and Title:
   - Attach a colorbar below the map, labeled with the dataset's units.
   - Set the title to include the file basename, dataset path, and long_name from attributes.

Okay, let's tackle this user query. The user wants a Python script that processes an HDF5 file with geospatial data. They've outlined specific steps, and I need to break it down into three sub-queries as per the instructions.

First, the HDF5 Dataset Access part. The user mentions using h5py to open the file and access specific datasets like /pt1/latitude, longitude, and h_corr. They also need to extract attributes like units and long_name, and get the _FillValue from h_corr. So the sub-query should focus on how to do all that with h5py. I need to make sure it's specific to accessing those paths and attributes, and handling the _FillValue.

Next, the NumPy-based Data Preprocessing. The user wants to convert h_corr to float, replace _FillValue with NaN, and mask the data. The sub-query here should be about using numpy functions like where or masked_where, handling _FillValue, and data conversion. I need to mention the exact functions and the process of replacing and masking.

Lastly, the Map Plotting and Visualization. The user is using matplotlib, basemap, and cartopy. They need an equidistant cylindrical projection, coastlines, parallels, meridians, scatter plot with specific parameters, colorbar, and title. The sub-query should focus on the libraries, projection setup, drawing elements, and adding the colorbar and title. I should specify the libraries and the exact steps for each visualization component.

I need to make sure each sub-query is clearly separated and targets the specific technical domain. No explanations or code, just the sub-queries. Let me check the user's note again to confirm the format. Yes, only the sub-queries in the specified format, no extra text. Alright, time to structure each part accordingly.

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
How to use h5py to open an HDF5 file with path "ICESat_2/ATL11_051911_0321_006_06.h5", access datasets at paths "/pt1/latitude", "/pt1/longitude", and "/pt1/h_corr", extract attributes "units" and "long_name" with ASCII decoding, and retrieve "_FillValue" from the h_corr dataset.

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
How to convert h_corr data to float, replace _FillValue with numpy NaN using np.where or np.ma.masked_where, and create a masked array for values containing NaN.
