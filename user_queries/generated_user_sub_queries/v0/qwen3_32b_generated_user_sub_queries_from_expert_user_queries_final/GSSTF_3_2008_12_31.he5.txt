        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
        A Python script to visualize data from a GESDISC MEaSUREs GSSTF HDF-EOS5 grid file.

Steps:
1. Import necessary libraries: os, h5py, numpy as np, matplotlib as mpl, matplotlib.pyplot as plt, and mpl_toolkits.basemap import Basemap.
2. Read the HDF file located at 'GSSTF_3_2008_12_31.he5'.
3. Extract the 'E' dataset from '/HDFEOS/GRIDS/SET1/Data Fields/E', including its attributes ('units' and 'long_name') using decode(), and retrieve the _FillValue attribute.
4. Preprocess data by replacing _FillValue with np.nan and create a masked array using np.masked_array with conditions based on np.isnan(data).
5. Construct longitude and latitude arrays based on the shape of the 'E' dataset since they are not provided in the file.
6. Create a cylindrical projection map with boundaries set for low resolution, latitudes from -90 to 90, and longitudes from -180 to 180.
7. Add parallels at the result of numpy arrange value of [-90, 120, 30] degrees latitude with labels [1,0,0,0], 
    and meridians at the result of numpy arrange value of [-180, 180, 45] degrees longitude with labels [0,0,0,1].
8. Visualize the data using pcolormesh with parameters longitude, latitude, data, and latlon=True.
9. Add a colorbar and a descriptive title to the plot.

Okay, let's tackle this user query. The user wants a Python script to visualize data from a GESDISC MEaSUREs GSSTF HDF-EOS5 grid file. They've outlined specific steps, so I need to break it down into the three required sub-queries.

First, the HDF5 Dataset Access part. The user is using h5py to read an HE5 file. They need to access the 'E' dataset at a specific path, get its attributes like units and long_name, and retrieve the _FillValue. So the sub-query should focus on using h5py to open the file, navigate the dataset path, and extract those attributes. I should mention the file extension and the dataset path structure.

Next, the NumPy-based Data Preprocessing. The user wants to replace _FillValue with np.nan and create a masked array. They mentioned using np.where or np.ma.masked_where. The sub-query needs to address handling _FillValue, replacing it with NaN, and creating a masked array based on NaNs. Also, maybe mention checking for min and max if needed for filtering, but the main focus is on the FillValue and masking.

For the Plotting and Visualization, the user is using Basemap with a cylindrical projection. They need to set up the map with specific boundaries, add coastlines, meridians, and parallels with given intervals and labels. The visualization uses pcolormesh with longitude, latitude, and data, including a colorbar and title. The sub-query should focus on Basemap setup, projection type, adding coastlines, drawing meridians and parallels with specified parameters, and using pcolormesh for plotting with latlon=True. Also, include adding a colorbar and title.

I need to make sure each sub-query is specific to its domain. Avoid mixing steps from different areas. Check that the sub-queries are clear and target the exact technical aspects required for each part of the task.

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
How to use h5py to open a HE5 file, access a dataset at path '/HDFEOS/GRIDS/SET1/Data Fields/E', retrieve attributes like 'units', 'long_name', and '_FillValue', and decode dataset values.

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
How to replace _FillValue with np.nan in a NumPy array, create a masked array using np.ma.masked_where with np.isnan(), and apply conditions for data filtering based on min/max values.

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
How to use Basemap with cylindrical projection to create a map with -90 to 90 latitude and -180 to 180 longitude boundaries, draw coastlines, add parallels at [-90, 120, 30] with labels [1,0,0,0], meridians at [-180, 180, 45] with labels [0,0,0,1], and plot data with pcolormesh including latlon=True, colorbar, and title.
