        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
        A Python script that reads an HDF5 file containing ASTER GED data, extracts specific datasets, and visualizes them on a map.

1. Import necessary libraries: os, matplotlib, matplotlib.pyplot, numpy, mpl_toolkits.basemap, h5py.

2. Read the input HDF5 file in read-only mode.

3. Extract datasets:
   - 'Mean Emissivity for Band 10' from '/Emissivity/Mean' as a 2D slice (1st index along x-axis).
   - Retrieve the Description attribute's 0th value.
   - Set units to None and long_name to 'Mean emissivity for Band 10'.

4. Extract geolocation data:
   - Latitude from '/Geolocation/Latitude'.
   - Longitude from '/Geolocation/Longitude'.

5. Process mean data:
   - Replace -9999 with NaN.
   - Scale by multiplying with 0.001.
   - Apply mask using numpy's masked_where.

6. Create an equidistant cylindrical projection map with Basemap, setting latitude (62.5-64.5) and longitude (89.5-87.5) ranges.

7. Add map features:
   - Coastlines with linewidth 0.5.
   - Parallels at 62, 63, 64 with specific labels of [1, 0, 0, 0]
   - Meridians at -89, -88, -87 with specific labels of [0, 0, 0, 1]

8. Plot data using pcolormesh with latlon=True.

9. Add colorbar labeled 'None' and a title combining the filename's base name with 'Mean Emissivity for Band 10'.

Okay, let's tackle this user query. The user wants a Python script that reads an HDF5 file with ASTER GED data, extracts specific datasets, and visualizes them on a map. They provided a detailed breakdown of steps, so I need to split this into three sub-queries as specified.

First, the HDF5 Dataset Access part. The user mentions using h5py to read the file and extract datasets like 'Mean Emissivity for Band 10' from a specific path. They also need to retrieve attributes like Description and handle units. So the sub-query should focus on accessing the HDF5 file, navigating the dataset paths, and retrieving attributes. I need to make sure to mention the exact paths and the attributes involved.

Next, the NumPy-based Data Preprocessing. The user wants to replace -9999 with NaN, scale by 0.001, and apply a mask. The sub-query here should address handling _FillValue (which is -9999 here), using numpy functions like masked_where, and the scaling process. It's important to note the specific values and functions used in preprocessing.

Lastly, the Plotting and Visualization. The user is using Basemap for an equidistant cylindrical projection, adding coastlines, parallels, meridians, and using pcolormesh with latlon=True. The sub-query needs to cover setting up the projection, configuring the latitude and longitude ranges, adding map features, and the plotting method. Also, the colorbar and title requirements should be included here.

I need to ensure each sub-query is focused on its respective domain without overlapping. Avoid any code examples, just the technical aspects. Check that all the user's steps are covered in each sub-query, using the correct libraries and functions as mentioned. Make sure the sub-queries are clear and specific so that they can be used to retrieve relevant documentation or examples from a vector database.

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:  
How to use h5py to open an HDF5 file in read-only mode, access datasets at paths like `/Emissivity/Mean` and `/Geolocation/Latitude`, retrieve attributes such as `Description` (0th value), and extract metadata including `units` and `long_name` for a dataset.  

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:  
How to replace values of -9999 with NaN in a NumPy array, scale data by multiplying with 0.001, and apply a mask using `np.ma.masked_where` to filter invalid values for geospatial data preprocessing.
