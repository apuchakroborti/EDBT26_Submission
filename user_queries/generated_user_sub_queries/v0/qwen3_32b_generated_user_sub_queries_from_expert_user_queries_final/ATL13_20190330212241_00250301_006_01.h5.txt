        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
        A Python script that processes an HDF5 file to generate a geospatial visualization. The script follows these steps:

1. Import Libraries: Include necessary modules for OS operations (os), plotting (matplotlib and matplotlib.pyplot), 
numerical computations (numpy), map projections (mpl_toolkits.basemap), and handling HDF5 files.

2. Define Constants: Set the FILE_NAME constant to "ATL13_20190330212241_00250301_006_01.h5".

3. Open HDF5 File: Open the file in read mode and access datasets at paths "/gt1l/segment_lat", "/gt1l/segment_lon", and "/gt1l/segment_geoid" 
   for latitude, longitude, and main data respectively.

4. Extract Attributes: From the segment_geoid dataset, read 'units' and 'long_name' attributes using decode('ascii', 'replace') and retrieve '_FillValue' from the main data. 
   Convert segment_geoid data to float type.

5. Data Processing:
   - Replace _FillValue in segment_geoid data with numpy NaN.
   - Mask data where values are NaN using numpy's masked_where function.

6. Map Setup: Create a cylindrical projection map with low resolution, setting latitude and longitude bounds from -90 to 90 and -180 to 180 respectively. 
   Add coastlines with line width 0.5, parallels at intervals [-90, -60, -30, 0, 30, 60, 90, 120], and meridians at intervals [-180, -135, -90, -45, 0, 45, 90, 135, 180].

7. Adjust Longitude: Subtract 180 degrees from longitude values before plotting.

8. Plot Data: Use scatter plot with parameters: longitude and latitude coordinates, data as color values (c=data), marker size 0.1, colormap 'jet', no edge colors, and zero linewidth.

9. Add Visualization Elements:
   - Include a colorbar at the bottom labeled with the main dataset's units.
   - Set the title to include the HDF5 file's basename and its long_name attribute.

This structured approach ensures clarity for code generation by an LLM.

Okay, let's tackle this user query. The user wants a Python script that processes an HDF5 file and generates a geospatial visualization. They've outlined specific steps, so I need to break it down into three sub-queries as per the instructions.

First, the HDF5 Dataset Access part. The user mentions using h5py to open the file and access specific datasets. The paths are given, like "/gt1l/segment_lat", etc. Also, they need to extract attributes like 'units', 'long_name', and '_FillValue'. So the sub-query should focus on how to open the HDF5 file with h5py, access those datasets, retrieve the attributes, and handle the _FillValue. I need to make sure to mention the exact paths and the attributes, and converting the data to float.

Next, the NumPy-based Data Preprocessing. The user wants to replace _FillValue with NaN and mask the data. The sub-query here should detail using numpy's masked_where or where functions. Mention replacing the _FillValue (which was retrieved from the HDF5 dataset) with NaN and then applying a mask. Also, converting the dataset to float is part of this step.

For the Plotting and Visualization, the user is using matplotlib and basemap. They need a cylindrical projection, setting the lat/lon bounds, adding coastlines, parallels, meridians. The longitude adjustment (subtracting 180) is part of this. The scatter plot parameters are specified, along with colorbar and title. The sub-query should focus on the libraries (matplotlib, basemap), projection setup, plotting the scatter, adding colorbar with units, and the title including the file's basename and long_name.

I need to make sure each sub-query is specific to its domain. No code, just the technical aspects. Check that all the user's steps are covered in each sub-query without overlapping. Also, ensure that the sub-queries are clear and can be used to retrieve relevant documentation or examples from a vector database.
