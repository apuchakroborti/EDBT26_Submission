"""
        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
        

Create a script to visualize precipitation rate data from an HDF5 file by following these steps:

1. Import Libraries: Use os, matplotlib, matplotlib.pyplot, numpy, mpl_toolkits.basemap, and h5py.

2. Open HDF5 File: Access the file in read-only mode and extract the `/FS/SLV/precipRateESurface` dataset along with its units and _FillValue attribute.

3. Handle Missing Data: Replace _FillValue entries with NaNs using numpy's masked_where function to mask the data where values are NaN.

4. Retrieve Geolocation Data: Extract latitude from `/FS/Latitude` and longitude from `/FS/Longitude`.

5. Set Up Map Projection: Create a cylindrical projection with low resolution, spanning latitudes from -90 to 90 and longitudes from -180 to 180.

6. Customize Map: Add coastlines (width 0.5), parallels at [-90, -45, 0, 45, 90], and meridians at [-180, -135, -90, -45, 0, 45, 90, 135, 180] with labels [True, False, False, True] with specific labels.

7. Plot Data: Use a scatter plot with the 'jet' colormap, point size of 1, based on longitude and latitude coordinates.

8. Add Colorbar and Title: Include a colorbar below the plot, labeled with the dataset's units, and set the title to reflect the file and dataset name.

Okay, let's tackle this user query. The user wants a script to visualize precipitation rate data from an HDF5 file. They've outlined specific steps, so I need to break it down into the three required sub-queries.

First, the HDF5 Dataset Access part. The user mentions using h5py to open the file in read-only mode and extract the dataset at `/FS/SLV/precipRateESurface` along with its units and _FillValue. So the sub-query should focus on accessing the HDF5 file with h5py, retrieving the dataset, and its attributes. I need to make sure to mention the specific path and the attributes they want.

Next, the NumPy-based Data Preprocessing. The user wants to replace _FillValue with NaNs using numpy's masked_where. The sub-query here should be about handling _FillValue, applying masks, and maybe computing min/max if needed. The key is to focus on the masking process and how to handle missing data with NumPy functions.

Lastly, the Map Plotting and Visualization. The user is using matplotlib, basemap, and wants a cylindrical projection with specific coastlines, parallels, meridians, and a colorbar. The sub-query needs to address setting up the projection, adding coastlines, drawing parallels and meridians with labels, using a scatter plot with the jet colormap, and adding a colorbar and title. I should mention the libraries involved and the specific elements like projection type, labels, and colorbar placement.

I need to ensure each sub-query is focused on its respective domain without overlapping. Also, check that the paths and parameters from the user's query are correctly included. Let me verify each part again to make sure I didn't miss any details. For example, the dataset path is `/FS/SLV/precipRateESurface`, and the geolocation paths are `/FS/Latitude` and `/FS/Longitude`. The projection is cylindrical, and the colorbar is below the plot. All these specifics should be in the sub-queries.

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
How to use `np.ma.masked_where` to replace `_FillValue` entries in a NumPy array with NaNs, and compute valid data ranges for filtering or normalization.

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
How to use `Basemap` with a cylindrical projection to plot geospatial scatter data, add coastlines (linewidth=0.5), customize parallels/meridians with specific labels, apply the 'jet' colormap, and add a colorbar below the plot with units and a title.
