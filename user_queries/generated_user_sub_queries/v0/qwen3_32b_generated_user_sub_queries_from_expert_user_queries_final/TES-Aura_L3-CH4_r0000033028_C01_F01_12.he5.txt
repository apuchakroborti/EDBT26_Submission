        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
        A Python script to read and visualize HDF-EOS5 file data.

1. Import Libraries: Include necessary libraries such as os, h5py, numpy (as np), matplotlib (as mpl), matplotlib.pyplot (as plt), and Basemap from mpl_toolkits.basemap.

2. Open File: Use h5py to open the file 'TES-Aura_L3-CH4_r0000033028_C01_F01_12.he5' in read mode.

3. Retrieve Data:
   - Extract grid metadata from '/HDFEOS INFORMATION/StructMetadata.0'.
   - Read SurfacePressure data from '/HDFEOS/GRIDS/NadirGrid/Data Fields/SurfacePressure' into a NumPy array (dtype float64).
   - Extract metadata: '_FillValue', 'MissingValue', 'Title' (using decode()), and 'Units' (using decode()) from the SurfacePressure dataset.

4. Process Data:
   - Identify invalid values using np.logical_or with SurfacePressure == _FillValue[0] and SurfacePressure == MissingValue[0].
   - Set invalid values to NaN.
   - Create a masked array using np.ma.masked_array with parameters SurfacePressure data and isnan(SurfacePressure).

5. Retrieve Coordinates:
   - Extract Longitude and Latitude from '/HDFEOS/GRIDS/NadirGrid/Data Fields/Longitude' and 'Latitude' as float64 NumPy arrays.

6. Create Map:
   - Initialize a Basemap object with cylindrical projection, resolution 'l', latitude range [-90, 90], longitude range [-180, 180].
   - Draw coastlines (linewidth=0.5), parallels (np.arange(-45, 91, 45) with labels [1,0,0,0]), and meridians (np.arange(-180, 180, 45) with labels [0,0,0,1]).

7. Visualize Data:
   - Use pcolormesh to plot data with longitude, latitude, SurfacePressure data, and latlon=True.
   - Add a colorbar with the Units label from metadata.
   - Set the title as a concatenation of the file's base name and the Title metadata.

Okay, let's tackle this user query. The user wants a Python script to read and visualize an HDF-EOS5 file. They've provided a detailed breakdown of the steps, so I need to extract three specific sub-queries based on the given categories.

First, the HDF5 Dataset Access sub-query. The user is using h5py to open the file and access specific datasets and attributes. I need to focus on how to open the file with h5py, access the datasets like '/Grid/cloudWater' (though in their example it's '/HDFEOS/GRIDS/NadirGrid/Data Fields/SurfacePressure'), and retrieve metadata such as _FillValue, Title, and Units. Also, the dataset paths and metadata extraction are key here.

Next, the NumPy-based Data Preprocessing. The user is handling _FillValue and MissingValue, using np.logical_or to identify invalid values, setting them to NaN, and creating a masked array. The sub-query should focus on techniques for handling these values, applying masks, and preprocessing steps like filtering with min/max or other logic.

Lastly, the Map Plotting and Visualization. The user is using Basemap from mpl_toolkits.basemap to create a cylindrical projection, draw coastlines, meridians, parallels, and add a colorbar. The sub-query needs to address how to configure projections, use pcolormesh with latlon=True, add colorbars with units, and set titles. Also, mention the libraries like matplotlib and Basemap.

I need to make sure each sub-query is specific to its domain, using the exact terms and functions mentioned. Avoid any overlap between the sub-queries and ensure they are clear and focused on the technical aspects required for each step.

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
How to use h5py to open an HDF-EOS5 file (.he5) and access datasets at specific paths like '/HDFEOS/GRIDS/NadirGrid/Data Fields/SurfacePressure', extract metadata attributes such as '_FillValue', 'MissingValue', 'Title', and 'Units', and read grid metadata from '/HDFEOS INFORMATION/StructMetadata.0'.

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
How to identify and mask invalid values in a NumPy array using _FillValue and MissingValue attributes, replace invalid values with NaN, and create a masked array using np.ma.masked_array with a boolean mask derived from np.isnan().

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
How to use Basemap (mpl_toolkits.basemap) to create a cylindrical projection map with specified latitude/longitude ranges, draw coastlines, configure labeled parallels/meridians, plot geospatial data with pcolormesh (latlon=True), add a colorbar with metadata-derived units, and set a title combining filename and dataset metadata.
