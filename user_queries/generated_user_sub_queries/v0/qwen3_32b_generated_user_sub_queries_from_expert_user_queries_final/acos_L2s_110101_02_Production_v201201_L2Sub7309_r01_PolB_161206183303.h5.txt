"""
        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
        Create a script that performs the following steps:

1. Import necessary libraries: os, matplotlib, matplotlib.pyplot, numpy, mpl_toolkits.basemap, and h5py.

2. Define a constant FILE_NAME with the name of the HDF5 file to be processed.

3. Open the specified HDF5 file in read-only mode.

4. Extract datasets from the file:
   - `/RetrievalResults/xco2` for xCO2 data
   - `/SoundingGeometry/sounding_latitude_geoid` for latitude data
   - `/SoundingGeometry/sounding_longitude_geoid` for longitude data
   - `/SoundingGeometry/sounding_altitude` for altitude data
   - `/RetrievalHeader/sounding_time_tai93` for time data

5. Retrieve the 'Units' attribute from both xco2 and altitude datasets at index 0.

6. Create a figure with two subplots:
   - First subplot: Orthographic projection map with low resolution, centered at lat_0 = -55 and lon_0 = 120, 
   displaying the sounding trajectory using latitude and longitude coordinates.
   - Second subplot: Line plot showing time vs xco2 data, with a twin axis for time vs altitude data.

7. Customize the map by adding:
   - Coastlines with a line width of 0.5
   - Parallels at latitudes [-80, -60, -40, -20, 0]
   - Meridians at longitudes from -180 to 180 with interval of 20

8. Customize both plots by setting appropriate axis labels, titles, and tick formats.

Okay, let's tackle this user query. The user wants a script that does several things involving HDF5 data, preprocessing with NumPy, and plotting with matplotlib and basemap. The task is to break this down into three sub-queries as specified.

First, for the HDF5 Dataset Access part. The user needs to open an HDF5 file using h5py and extract specific datasets. The sub-query should focus on how to access these datasets, including their paths and retrieving attributes like 'Units'. So I need to mention using h5py to open the file, accessing the datasets by their exact paths, and getting the 'Units' attribute from xco2 and altitude. Also, the file extension is HDF5, so that's important to include.

Next, the NumPy-based Data Preprocessing. The user's query mentions handling _FillValue and applying masks. However, looking at the user's steps, they don't explicitly mention _FillValue, but maybe the datasets might have it. The sub-query should focus on using np.where or np.ma to handle any invalid data, maybe filtering based on min and max. But the user's step 4 just extracts the datasets, so maybe the preprocessing is about handling missing data. So the sub-query should ask about applying masks using NumPy functions to handle such cases.

Lastly, the Plotting and Visualization. The user wants two subplots: one with an orthographic projection using basemap, and another with a line plot and twin axis. The sub-query needs to focus on using matplotlib and basemap for the map, setting the projection, adding coastlines, parallels, meridians. Also, the second subplot's twin axis for time vs xco2 and altitude. So the sub-query should ask about creating subplots with specific projections, customizing elements like coastlines, parallels, meridians, and twin axes for dual y-axes.

I need to make sure each sub-query is specific to its domain. For HDF5, it's about accessing datasets and attributes. For NumPy, it's about data handling and masks. For plotting, it's about the libraries and visualization setup. Also, the user mentioned using mpl_toolkits.basemap, so that's part of the plotting sub-query. The answer should not include code but just the sub-queries as per the format.

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
How to use h5py to open an HDF5 file with .hdf5 extension, access datasets at paths /RetrievalResults/xco2, /SoundingGeometry/sounding_latitude_geoid, /SoundingGeometry/sounding_longitude_geoid, /SoundingGeometry/sounding_altitude, /RetrievalHeader/sounding_time_tai93, and retrieve the 'Units' attribute from the xco2 and altitude datasets at index 0.

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
How to handle potential _FillValue attributes in NumPy arrays, apply masking using np.ma.masked_where or np.where for invalid data, and compute/normalize xco2 and altitude data arrays for visualization.

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
How to create a matplotlib figure with two subplots: (1) an orthographic projection map using Basemap with lat_0=-55, lon_0=120, low resolution, coastlines (linewidth=0.5), parallels [-80,-60,-40,-20,0], and meridians (-180 to 180, 20° interval); (2) a twin-axis line plot showing time vs xco2 (primary y-axis) and time vs altitude (secondary y-axis) with appropriate labels, titles, and colorbars.
