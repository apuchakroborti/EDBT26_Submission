        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
        1. File Input and Constants
   - Specify the input file `MOP02N-20180311-L2V19.9.2.he5` stored in the constant `FILE_NAME`.
   - Import necessary libraries: `os`, `datetime`, `h5py`, `numpy` as `np`, `matplotlib` as `mpl`, `matplotlib.pyplot` as `plt`, and `mpl_toolkits.basemap.Basemap`.

2. Extracting Data
   - Extract data from the HDF5 dataset at `/HDFEOS/SWATHS/MOP02/Data Fields/RetrievedCOTotalColumn`.
   - Read the contents into an array called `data`, taking only the first column.
   - Retrieve the `units` and `_FillValue` attributes associated with this dataset.
   - Replace the `_FillValue` in the `RetrievedCOTotalColumn` data with `numpy.nan`.

3. Extracting Geolocation Data
   - Extract latitude values from `/HDFEOS/SWATHS/MOP02/Geolocation Fields/Latitude`.
   - Extract longitude values from `/HDFEOS/SWATHS/MOP02/Geolocation Fields/Longitude`.

4. Creating a Map
   - Add coastlines with a line width of 0.5.
   - Draw parallels using `numpy.arange(-90, 91, 45)`.
   - Draw meridians using `numpy.arange(-180, 181, 45)` and set labels to `[True, False, False, True]`.

5. Scatter Plot
   - Create a scatter plot with parameters: longitude, latitude, data array `c=data`, marker size `s=1`, colormap `plt.cm.jet`, no edge colors (`edgecolors=None`), and line width `linewidth=0`.

6. Customizing the Map
   - Add a colorbar to represent the units of the data.
   - Set the colorbar label using the `units` attribute from the dataset.

Okay, let's tackle this user query. The user wants to break down their task into three sub-queries for HDF5 access, NumPy preprocessing, and visualization. 

First, for the HDF5 part. The user is working with an HE5 file, so I need to focus on using h5py to access datasets. They mentioned specific paths like /HDFEOS/SWATHS/MOP02/Data Fields/RetrievedCOTotalColumn. The sub-query should include accessing the dataset, reading attributes like units and _FillValue, and handling the first column. Also, they need to replace _FillValue with NaN, but that might be part of the preprocessing step.

Next, the NumPy preprocessing. The main points here are handling _FillValue by replacing it with NaN, using functions like np.where or np.ma.masked_where. They also need to extract the first column of the data array. So the sub-query should cover replacing fill values and array slicing.

For the visualization part, the user is using Basemap to create a map. They want coastlines, parallels, meridians with specific intervals, and a scatter plot with certain parameters. The sub-query should mention using Basemap, setting up the projection, drawing coastlines, parallels, meridians, and adding a colorbar with the units from the dataset.

I need to make sure each sub-query is focused on its respective domain without overlapping. Also, check that all the user's requirements are covered in each section. Let me structure each sub-query clearly, using the specified keywords and avoiding any code or explanations.

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
How to use h5py to open an HE5 file, access datasets at paths like /HDFEOS/SWATHS/MOP02/Data Fields/RetrievedCOTotalColumn and /HDFEOS/SWATHS/MOP02/Geolocation Fields/Latitude, read dataset attributes (units, _FillValue), and extract specific columns from 2D datasets.

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
How to replace _FillValue in NumPy arrays with numpy.nan, extract the first column of a 2D array, and apply masking or conditional replacement operations using np.where or np.ma.masked_where for data cleaning.

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
How to use Basemap to create a geospatial plot with cylindrical projection, draw coastlines (linewidth=0.5), set parallels (numpy.arange(-90,91,45)), meridians (numpy.arange(-180,181,45) with label configuration), create a scatter plot with longitude/latitude coordinates (c=data, s=1, cmap=jet), and add a colorbar with dynamic label from dataset attributes.
