"""
        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            I want to create a line chart of the Dow Jones Industrial Average from October 2006 to August 2013 using Python. The data is in '83_h5_data.h5' with dataset "Date", "Dow Jones Industrial Average" and "1 Year moving average". Write a Python code to read the data and draw two lines on the chart. You should also color the area between the lines based on certain rules. Then add a title, labels, and a legend, and make sure the dates are readable.

        ---
        Note: return only the the response of sub-queries only based on the below format, not explanation, not python code, and node additional text needed
        Return format:

        HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
        <generated sub-query>

        NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
        <generated sub-query>

        Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
        <generated sub-query>
        """

Here are the generated sub-queries:

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
Access HDF5 file '83_h5_data.h5' using h5py, read datasets "Date", "Dow Jones Industrial Average" and "1 Year moving average".

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
Handle _FillValue in dataset, apply masks to filter data, compute or filter data using min, max, or other preprocessing logic.

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
Create a line chart with two lines using matplotlib, configure date axis, add title, labels, legend, and color the area between the lines based on certain rules.
