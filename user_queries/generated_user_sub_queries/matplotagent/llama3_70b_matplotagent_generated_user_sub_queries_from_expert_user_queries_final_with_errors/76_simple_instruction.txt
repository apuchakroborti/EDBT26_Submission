"""
        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            Write a code to read h5 data named '76_h5_data.h5' and visualize the "women's millions of dollars" dataset with a composite graph: an axis-free box plot above and a histogram below. Label key statistics on the box plot and detail the frequency distribution in the histogram. Highlight quartiles with continuous red dashed lines across both sections, ensuring no breaks.

        ---
        Note: return only the the response of sub-queries only based on the below format, not explanation, not python code, and node additional text needed
        Return format:

        HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
        <generated sub-query>

        NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
        <generated sub-query>

        Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
        <generated sub-query>
        """

Here are the generated sub-queries:

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
Access HDF5 file '76_h5_data.h5' using h5py, retrieve dataset "women's millions of dollars" from a specific path.

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
Handle _FillValue in NumPy array, apply mask to remove missing values, compute quartiles and filter data for visualization.

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
Create a composite graph with axis-free box plot above and histogram below using matplotlib or cartopy, label key statistics on the box plot, detail frequency distribution in the histogram, and highlight quartiles with continuous red dashed lines.
