"""
        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            Create two ternary phase diagrams from the dataset "97_h5_data.h5", containing 'No.', 'IL (25°C)', 'toluene (25°C)', and 'n-heptane (25°C)'. Each same index data from each datasets indicates a mixture composition of these components at 25°C, with 'No.' indicating different groups or conditions.

For both diagrams:
- Title: "Liquid-Liquid Phase Diagram".

1. Equilateral Triangle Diagram:
  - Plot with 'toluene' at the top, 'n-heptane' at the bottom left, and 'IL' at the bottom right.
  - Transform component fractions to Cartesian coordinates for an equilateral layout.
  - Plot data points as circles, connect same 'No.' group points with dashed lines, and use different colors for each group.
  - Label each vertex with the component name and draw borders for the triangle and remove axis ticks and labels for a clean look.
2. Right-Angled Triangle Diagram:
  - Plot with 'IL' on the vertical axis, 'toluene' on the horizontal axis, right angle at the bottom left.
  - Transform for a right-angled layout, similarly plot and connect points, using the same color scheme.
  - Label axes with 'IL' and 'toluene', and draw borders for the triangle and remove axis ticks and labels for a clean look.
Display both diagrams side-by-side, maintaining an equal aspect ratio for comparison.

        ---
        Note: return only the the response of sub-queries only based on the below format, not explanation, not python code, and node additional text needed
        Return format:

        HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
        <generated sub-query>

        NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
        <generated sub-query>

        Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
        <generated sub-query>
        """

Here are the 3 sub-queries:

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
Access HDF5 file "97_h5_data.h5" using h5py, retrieve datasets 'No.', 'IL (25°C)', 'toluene (25°C)', and 'n-heptane (25°C)' with their paths.

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
Handle _FillValue in the retrieved datasets, apply masks to filter out invalid data, compute or filter data using min, max, and other preprocessing logic for ternary phase diagrams.

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
Use matplotlib, mpl_toolkits.basemap, or cartopy to create two ternary phase diagrams with equilateral and right-angled triangle layouts, configure projections, draw coastlines, meridians, parallels, apply colorbars or titles, and display both diagrams side-by-side with equal aspect ratio.
