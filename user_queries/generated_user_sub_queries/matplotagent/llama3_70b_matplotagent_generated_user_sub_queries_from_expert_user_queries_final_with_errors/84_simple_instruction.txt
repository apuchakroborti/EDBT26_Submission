"""
        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            I want to create a phase diagram of water using Python. The data is in a file called '84_h5_data.h5'.

- First, you should set up the chart with a horizontal axis for temperature and a vertical axis for pressure. These should be marked in Celsius, Kelvin, Pascals, bars and millibars, with conversions where necessary.
- Next, you should use the data to draw the lines that separate the solid, liquid, and gas phases of water. Use datasets Pressure(gas) and Pressure(liquid) of data to draw the line that separates the solid, liquid, and gas phases. Use datasets  temperature(K) and temperature(K).1 to draw the line that separates the solid and liquid phases.
- You should also mark two special points: the triple point at 273.16 K and 611.657 Pa, where solid, liquid, and gas coexist, and the critical point at 647.396 K and 22.064 MPa, where there's no difference between liquid and gas.
- You should draw two vertical red lines to show the freezing and boiling points of water at normal pressure.
- Make sure to label everything clearly, and color the different regions to show the solid, liquid, and gas phases.
- Finally, you should add a grid to make the chart easier to read, and ensure the pressure scale is logarithmic, since phase diagrams often cover a wide range of pressures.

        Note: return only the the response of sub-queries only based on the below format, not explanation, not python code, and node additional text needed
        Return format:

        HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
        <generated sub-query>

        NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
        <generated sub-query>

        Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
        <generated sub-query>
        """

Here are the 3 sub-queries:

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
Access HDF5 file '84_h5_data.h5' using h5py, retrieve datasets Pressure(gas), Pressure(liquid), temperature(K), and temperature(K).1.

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
Handle _FillValue in Pressure and temperature datasets, apply masks to remove invalid data, compute conversions between Celsius and Kelvin, and Pascals, bars, and millibars.

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
Create a phase diagram with matplotlib or cartopy, configure logarithmic pressure axis, draw lines separating solid, liquid, and gas phases using Pressure and temperature datasets, add vertical red lines for freezing and boiling points, label axes and regions clearly, and add grid for readability.
