"""
        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            I have data of iris flower named "79_h5_data.h5". Generate a 3D scatter plot from "79_h5_data.h5" using the datasets "Petal Length(cm)", "Petal width(cm)", "Sepal Length(cm)", and "Species". Use distinct colors to represent each iris flower species. For each species, include confidence ellipses that encompass 95% of the data points, ensuring these ellipses are aligned with the principal axes of variation in the dataset. The confidence ellipses should be solid, opaque, and color-matched to the scatter points of each species, without any wireframes. Ensure the plot includes labeled axes for 'Petal Length', 'Petal Width', and 'Sepal Length', and add a legend that clearly identifies each species by its corresponding color.

        ---
        Note: return only the the response of sub-queries only based on the below format, not explanation, not python code, and node additional text needed
        Return format:

        HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
        <generated sub-query>

        NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
        <generated sub-query>

        Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
        <generated sub-query>

Here are the generated sub-queries:

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
Accessing HDF5 file "79_h5_data.h5" with h5py, retrieving datasets "Petal Length(cm)", "Petal width(cm)", and "Sepal Length(cm)".

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
Handling _FillValue in NumPy arrays, applying masks to filter data, computing min and max values for "Petal Length(cm)", "Petal width(cm)", and "Sepal Length(cm)" datasets.

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
Creating a 3D scatter plot with matplotlib or cartopy, using distinct colors for each iris flower species, adding confidence ellipses aligned with principal axes of variation, and configuring labeled axes and legend.
