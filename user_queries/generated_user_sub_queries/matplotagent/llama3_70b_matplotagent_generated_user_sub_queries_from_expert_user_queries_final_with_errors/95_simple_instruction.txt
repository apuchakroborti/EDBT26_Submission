"""
        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            Create a polar coordinate diagram using data from "95_h5_data.h5" to display the highest temperatures on the first of each month in Amherst, spanning from January 1, 2004, to August 1, 2015. The data includes datasets labeled "Year," "Date," and "Temperature." The diagram should include:

- 12 sectors, each representing a month of the year.
- Temperature data plotted according to the corresponding month.
- Circular points for the temperature data, slightly offset to prevent alignment along a single radial line.
- Abbreviated labels for the months (Jan, Feb, Mar, etc.).
- A blue curve that connects the data points from the year 2015.
- A legend positioned on the right side of the diagram.
- A title: "Monthly Highest Temperature in Amherst (2004-2015)."
The purpose of the diagram is to clearly illustrate the temperature trends and monthly variations over the years, with an emphasis on the data from 2015.

        Note: return only the the response of sub-queries only based on the below format, not explanation, not python code, and node additional text needed
        Return format:

        HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:

        Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:

        """

Here are the 3 sub-queries:

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
Access HDF5 file "95_h5_data.h5" using h5py, retrieve datasets "Year", "Date", and "Temperature", and extract metadata.

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
Filter temperature data to select highest temperatures on the first of each month, handle _FillValue, apply masks, and compute or filter data using min, max, or other preprocessing logic.

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
Create a polar coordinate diagram with 12 sectors representing months, plot temperature data according to corresponding month, use circular points with offset, include abbreviated month labels, blue curve connecting 2015 data points, legend on the right side, and title "Monthly Highest Temperature in Amherst (2004-2015)".
