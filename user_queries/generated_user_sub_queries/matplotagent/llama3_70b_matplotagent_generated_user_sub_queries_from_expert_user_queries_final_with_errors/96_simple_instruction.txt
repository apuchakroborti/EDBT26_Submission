"""
        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            Create a combination chart from the "96_h5_data.h5" dataset, which contains sales data for various mobile phone brands across different quarters of the year. The datasets in the h5 file are ["Quarter", "Samsung", "Nokia/Microsoft", "Apple", "LG", "ZTE", "Huawei"]. For each brand, create a box plot to represent the distribution of their sales data. On each box plot, display all the individual sales data points for that brand. Additionally, calculate the average sales for each brand and draw a line connecting these average values across the box plots. Use a consistent color scheme for the same quarter across different years, varying the shades to distinguish between years. Include a legend to aid in understanding the color coding.

        ---
        Note: return only the the response of sub-queries only based on the below format, not explanation, not python code, and node additional text needed
        Return format:

        HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
        <generated sub-query>

        NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
        <generated sub-query>

        Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
        <generated sub-query>
        """

Here are the 3 sub-queries:

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
Access HDF5 file "96_h5_data.h5" using h5py, retrieve datasets ["Quarter", "Samsung", "Nokia/Microsoft", "Apple", "LG", "ZTE", "Huawei"] and their metadata.

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
Handle _FillValue in sales data, apply masks to filter out missing values, compute average sales for each brand, and prepare data for box plotting.

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
Create a combination chart with multiple box plots using matplotlib or cartopy, configure consistent color scheme across quarters, draw lines connecting average sales values, and include a legend to explain color coding.
