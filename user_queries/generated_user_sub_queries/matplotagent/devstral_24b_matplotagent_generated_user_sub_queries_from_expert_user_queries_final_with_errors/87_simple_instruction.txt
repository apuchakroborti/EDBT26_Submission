"""
        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            Utilize the following datasets from '87_h5_data.h5' to create a sunburst plot:
- 'country': for the names of the countries,
- 'continent': to indicate which continent each country is in,
- 'lifeExp': showing the expected lifespan in each country,
- 'pop': representing the population of each country.
Your chart should:
- Organize the data hierarchically, starting with continents and then breaking down into countries.
- Use the population of each country to determine the size of its segment in the chart.
- Color code each segment by the country's expected lifespan, transitioning from red to blue across the range of values.
- Set the central value of the color scale to the average lifespan, weighted by the population of the countries.
- Finally, include a legend to help interpret the lifespan values as indicated by the color coding.

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
How to access datasets named 'country', 'continent', 'lifeExp', and 'pop' from a file called '87_h5_data.h5' using h5py?

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
How to handle missing values with `_FillValue`, apply masks, and compute weighted average lifespan based on population using NumPy?

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
How to create a sunburst plot in matplotlib or other libraries that organizes data hierarchically (continents → countries), sizes segments by population, colors segments by lifespan from red to blue, centers color scale at the weighted average lifespan, and includes a legend?
