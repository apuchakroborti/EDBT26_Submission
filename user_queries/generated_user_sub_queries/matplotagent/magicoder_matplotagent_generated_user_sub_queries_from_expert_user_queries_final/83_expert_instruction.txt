"""
        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            I want to plot a line graph of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) from October 2006 to August 2013.
The data is in '83_h5_data.h5'
The data contains three datasets:
    `date`: The date of the record.
    `Dow Jones Industrial Average`: The daily closing value of the DJIA.
    `1 year Moving Average`: The 1-year moving average value of the DJIA.
With this data, you can plot the line graph using Python. Here's how you can do it:

- Read the data from the h5 file using h5py.
- Convert the date datasets values to datetime for proper plotting.
- Plot the daily DJIA values and the 1-year moving average as lines on the graph.
- Fill the area between the lines with the appropriate colors using the fill_between method.
- Set the title of the graph and labels for the X and Y axes.
- Adjust the X-axis to display the dates in a readable format.
- Add a legend to the graph.

 HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
```python
import h5py

# Open the file
with h5py.File('83_h5_data.h5', 'r') as f:

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
```python

masked_array = np.ma.masked_where(_FillValue, data)

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
