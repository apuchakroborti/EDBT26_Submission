        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            Create two ternary phase diagrams from the dataset "97_h5_data.h5", containing 'No.', 'IL (25°C)', 'toluene (25°C)', and 'n-heptane (25°C)'. Each same index data from each datasets indicates a mixture composition of these components at 25°C, with 'No.' indicating different groups or conditions.

For both diagrams:
- Title: "Liquid-Liquid Phase Diagram".

1. Equilateral Triangle Diagram:
  - Plot with 'toluene' at the top, 'n-heptane' at the bottom left, and 'IL' at the bottom right.
  - Transform component fractions to Cartesian coordinates for an equilateral layout.
  - Plot data points as circles, connect same 'No.' group points with dashed lines, and use different colors for each group.
  - Label each vertex with the component name and draw borders for the triangle and remove axis ticks and labels for a clean look.
2. Right-Angled Triangle Diagram:
  - Plot with 'IL' on the vertical axis, 'toluene' on the horizontal axis, right angle at the bottom left.
  - Transform for a right-angled layout, similarly plot and connect points, using the same color scheme.
  - Label axes with 'IL' and 'toluene', and draw borders for the triangle and remove axis ticks and labels for a clean look.
Display both diagrams side-by-side, maintaining an equal aspect ratio for comparison.

Alright, I need to break down the user's query into three specific sub-queries as per their instructions. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, the HDF5 Dataset Access. The user is working with a file named "97_h5_data.h5" and needs to access datasets like 'No.', 'IL (25°C)', 'toluene (25°C)', and 'n-heptane (25°C)'. I should focus on how to use h5py to open the file, read these specific datasets by their paths, and retrieve any necessary metadata. So, the sub-query here is about accessing these datasets using h5py.

Next, the NumPy-based Data Preprocessing part. The user wants to create ternary phase diagrams, which means they'll need to transform component fractions into Cartesian coordinates for both equilateral and right-angled triangles. They also mentioned handling _FillValue, applying masks, and filtering data. So, I should generate a sub-query that covers these preprocessing steps using NumPy functions.

Lastly, the Plotting and Visualization section. The user wants two diagrams side by side: an equilateral triangle diagram and a right-angled one. They specified how to plot each component, connect points with dashed lines, use color schemes based on 'No.', label vertices or axes, and remove ticks and labels for a clean look. I'll need to focus on using matplotlib for this, possibly with basemap or cartopy if geospatial elements are involved, but since it's ternary diagrams, maybe just standard plotting functions.

Putting it all together, each sub-query should be clear and target the specific technical domain without overlapping too much. Now, I'll structure them as per the user's format.

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
How to access datasets 'No.', 'IL (25°C)', 'toluene (25°C)', and 'n-heptane (25°C)' from the HDF5 file "97_h5_data.h5" using h5py, including dataset paths and metadata retrieval.

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
How to transform component fractions into Cartesian coordinates for equilateral and right-angled triangle diagrams using NumPy, handle _FillValue, apply masks, and filter data for ternary phase diagram plotting.

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
How to create side-by-side ternary phase diagrams (equilateral and right-angled) using matplotlib or mpl_toolkits.basemap, configure projections, label vertices/axes, connect points with dashed lines, apply color schemes, and remove axis ticks and labels for a clean look.
