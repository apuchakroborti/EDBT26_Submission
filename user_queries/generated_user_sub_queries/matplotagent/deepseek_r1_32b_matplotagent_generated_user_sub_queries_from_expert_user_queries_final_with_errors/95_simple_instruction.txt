"""
        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            Create a polar coordinate diagram using data from "95_h5_data.h5" to display the highest temperatures on the first of each month in Amherst, spanning from January 1, 2004, to August 1, 2015. The data includes datasets labeled "Year," "Date," and "Temperature." The diagram should include:

- 12 sectors, each representing a month of the year.
- Temperature data plotted according to the corresponding month.
- Circular points for the temperature data, slightly offset to prevent alignment along a single radial line.
- Abbreviated labels for the months (Jan, Feb, Mar, etc.).
- A blue curve that connects the data points from the year 2015.
- A legend positioned on the right side of the diagram.
- A title: "Monthly Highest Temperature in Amherst (2004-2015)."
The purpose of the diagram is to clearly illustrate the temperature trends and monthly variations over the years, with an emphasis on the data from 2015.

Alright, I need to break down the user's query into three specific sub-queries as per the guidelines. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, the HDF5 Dataset Access. The user is working with a file named "95_h5_data.h5" and needs to access datasets labeled "Year," "Date," and "Temperature." So I should focus on how to use h5py to open this file, retrieve these specific datasets, and perhaps extract metadata or attributes related to them.

Next, the NumPy-based Data Preprocessing. The user wants the highest temperatures on the first of each month from 2004 to 2015. I need to think about how to filter the data for January 1st each year up to August 1, 2015. Also, handling any _FillValue is important here, so preprocessing steps like masking or filtering out invalid data points should be considered.

Lastly, the Map Plotting and Visualization. The user wants a polar coordinate diagram with specific elements: 12 sectors for each month, circular points offset to prevent alignment, abbreviated month labels, a blue curve for 2015 data, a legend on the right, and a title. I should focus on using matplotlib's polar plotting capabilities, configuring the axes, adding annotations, and ensuring all visual elements are correctly implemented.

I need to make sure each sub-query is clear and targets only its specific domain without overlapping with others.

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
How to access datasets labeled "Year," "Date," and "Temperature" from an HDF5 file named "95_h5_data.h5" using h5py, including extracting metadata or attributes.

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
How to filter and process temperature data for the highest temperatures on the first of each month between January 1, 2004, and August 1, 2015, handling _FillValue and preparing data for plotting.

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
How to create a polar coordinate diagram with 12 sectors representing months, plot temperature data as circular points offset in matplotlib, add abbreviated month labels, draw a blue curve for 2015 data, include a legend on the right, and set the title "Monthly Highest Temperature in Amherst (2004-2015)."
