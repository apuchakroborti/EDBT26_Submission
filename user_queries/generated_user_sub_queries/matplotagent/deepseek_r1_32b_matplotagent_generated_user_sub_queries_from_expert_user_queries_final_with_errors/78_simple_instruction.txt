"""
        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            Create a Python script to generate a 3D scatter plot from a h5 file named "78_h5_data.h5" with datasets ["0-60 mph(sec)", "Gas Mileage(mpg)", "Power(kw)", "Weight(kg)", "Engine Displacement(CC)"]. The plot should meet the following specifications:
- Plot each car as a point in 3D space using its acceleration time, gas mileage, and power as coordinates.
- Point sizes should increase with the engine displacement, and colors should vary from one end of the spectrum (like purple) for smaller engines to the other end (like yellow) for larger engines.
- Add flat projections of these points onto the XY, ZX, and YZ planes below and to the sides of the 3D points, colored blue, red, and green, respectively.
- Include a color bar to indicate the relationship between color and engine displacement.
- Label each axis to show what it represents and use a 3D perspective for viewing the plot.
- Ensure the plot has a modern and clean design, with clear, semi-transparent points to avoid visual clutter.

Alright, I need to break down the user's query into three specific sub-queries as per their instructions. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, the HDF5 Dataset Access sub-query. The user is working with a file named "78_h5_data.h5" and needs to access several datasets: ["0-60 mph(sec)", "Gas Mileage(mpg)", "Power(kw)", "Weight(kg)", "Engine Displacement(CC)"]. So, I should focus on how to use h5py to open this file, read these specific datasets by their paths, and retrieve any necessary metadata. That's straightforward.

Next, the NumPy-based Data Preprocessing sub-query. The user wants each car represented as a point in 3D space using acceleration time, gas mileage, and power. So, I need to extract those datasets into NumPy arrays. Then, handle _FillValue if there are any missing or invalid data points. Also, the point sizes should increase with engine displacement, which means scaling the 'Engine Displacement(CC)' dataset appropriately for visualization purposes.

Lastly, the Plotting and Visualization sub-query. The main plot is a 3D scatter plot using matplotlib. Points need to vary in size based on engine displacement and color from purple to yellow. Additionally, projections onto XY, ZX, and YZ planes with specific colors are required. Including a color bar for displacement, labeling axes, setting a modern design, and ensuring semi-transparent points are all part of this sub-query.

I should make sure each sub-query is clear and targets the specified technical domains without overlapping information.
