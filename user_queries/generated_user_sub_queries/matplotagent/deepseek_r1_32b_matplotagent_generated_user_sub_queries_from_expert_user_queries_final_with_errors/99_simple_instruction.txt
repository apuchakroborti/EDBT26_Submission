"""
        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            Create a dark-themed violin plot to compare the total bill amounts by day of the week from a h5 file named "99_h5_data.h5" which includes datasets "total_bill", "tip", "Sex", "Smoker", "day", "time", and "size". The plot should clearly distinguish between smokers and non-smokers using a green color for smokers and grey for non-smokers. Include split violins to show this distinction, and make sure the plot represents data quartiles inside each violin.

        ---
        Note: return only the the response of sub-queries only based on the below format, not explanation, not python code, and node additional text needed
        Return format:

        HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
        <generated sub-query>

        NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:

        Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:

<think>
Alright, I need to break down the user's query into three specific sub-queries as per the guidelines. Let me start by understanding each part of their request.

The user wants to create a dark-themed violin plot comparing total bill amounts by day of the week from an HDF5 file named "99_h5_data.h5". The datasets include "total_bill", "tip", "Sex", "Smoker", "day", "time", and "size". They also want to distinguish between smokers and non-smokers using green and grey colors, split violins, and show quartiles.

First, for the HDF5 Dataset Access sub-query, I need to focus on accessing the specific datasets from the file. The relevant datasets here are "total_bill" and "Smoker", so the sub-query should ask how to access these using h5py.

Next, the NumPy-based Data Preprocessing part involves handling any missing or invalid data. Since the user didn't mention _FillValue specifically, I'll assume they might need to handle such cases. So, the sub-query should cover checking for and handling any fill values in "total_bill" and "Smoker".

Lastly, for Plotting and Visualization, the focus is on creating a violin plot with specific themes and color distinctions. The user wants a dark theme, split violins by smoker status, quartiles shown, and appropriate labels. So, the sub-query should ask about using matplotlib to achieve this setup.

I need to ensure each sub-query is clear and targets only its respective domain without overlapping information.

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
How to access datasets "total_bill" and "Smoker" from an HDF5 file named "99_h5_data.h5" using h5py?

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
How to handle _FillValue in NumPy arrays for "total_bill" and "Smoker" datasets, and how to split the data into smokers and non-smokers using np.where or np.ma.masked_where?

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
How to create a dark-themed violin plot with split violins for smokers and non-smokers using matplotlib, with green for smokers and grey for non-smokers, including quartiles?
