"""
        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            I have data of iris flower named "79_h5_data.h5". Generate a 3D scatter plot from "79_h5_data.h5" using the datasets "Petal Length(cm)", "Petal width(cm)", "Sepal Length(cm)", and "Species". Use distinct colors to represent each iris flower species. For each species, include confidence ellipses that encompass 95% of the data points, ensuring these ellipses are aligned with the principal axes of variation in the dataset. The confidence ellipses should be solid, opaque, and color-matched to the scatter points of each species, without any wireframes. Ensure the plot includes labeled axes for 'Petal Length', 'Petal Width', and 'Sepal Length', and add a legend that clearly identifies each species by its corresponding color.

        ---
        Note: return only the the response of sub-queries only based on the below format, not explanation, not python code, and node additional text needed
        Return format:

Alright, I need to break down the user's query into three specific sub-queries as per the guidelines. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, the HDF5 Dataset Access sub-query should focus on accessing the "79_h5_data.h5" file and extracting the specified datasets: "Petal Length(cm)", "Petal width(cm)", "Sepal Length(cm)", and "Species". I need to make sure it's clear that we're using h5py for this task.

Next, the NumPy-based Data Preprocessing sub-query should handle how to process these datasets. This includes identifying unique species, assigning colors, computing confidence ellipses with 95% coverage aligned to principal axes, and ensuring no wireframes are used. I'll need to mention using np.unique for species, color assignment, and the methods for ellipse computation.

Lastly, the Plotting and Visualization sub-query should cover creating a 3D scatter plot with matplotlib. It needs to include distinct colors per species, adding confidence ellipses as solid and opaque, labeling axes correctly, and including a legend. I'll specify using mplot3d toolkit and ensure all visual elements are properly configured.

I need to make sure each sub-query is clear and focused on its respective domain without overlapping with the others.
