"""
        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            I want to create a line chart of the Dow Jones Industrial Average from October 2006 to August 2013 using Python. The data is in '83_h5_data.h5' with dataset "Date", "Dow Jones Industrial Average" and "1 Year moving average". Write a Python code to read the data and draw two lines on the chart. You should also color the area between the lines based on certain rules. Then add a title, labels, and a legend, and make sure the dates are readable.

        ---
        Note: return only the the response of sub-queries only based on the below format, not explanation, not python code, and node additional text needed
        Return format:

        HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
        <generated sub-query>

        NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
        <generated sub-query>

        Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
        <generated sub-query>

Alright, I need to break down the user's query into three specific sub-queries. Let me start by understanding what each part of their request entails.

First, they want to read data from an HDF5 file named '83_h5_data.h5'. The datasets they're interested in are "Date", "Dow Jones Industrial Average", and "1 Year moving average". So the first sub-query should focus on accessing these specific datasets using h5py. I'll make sure to mention the correct paths and metadata retrieval.

Next, the user wants to preprocess the data. They mentioned handling _FillValue, which suggests they might have missing or invalid data points. Using NumPy functions like np.where or np.ma.masked_where could help in masking these values. Additionally, they need to compute moving averages, so I'll include that in the preprocessing sub-query.

Finally, for visualization, they want a line chart with two lines and an area between them colored based on certain rules. They also specified adding titles, labels, legend, and ensuring dates are readable. So the plotting sub-query should cover using matplotlib to create the figure, plot the lines, shade the area, format the date axis, and add all necessary annotations.

I'll structure each sub-query clearly, making sure they're focused on their respective domains without overlapping.

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
How to read datasets "Date", "Dow Jones Industrial Average", and "1 Year moving average" from '83_h5_data.h5' using h5py?

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
How to handle _FillValue in NumPy arrays, apply masks using np.where or np.ma.masked_where, and compute moving averages for the Dow Jones data?

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
How to create a line chart with two lines using matplotlib, shade the area between them based on rules, add title, labels, legend, and format dates?
