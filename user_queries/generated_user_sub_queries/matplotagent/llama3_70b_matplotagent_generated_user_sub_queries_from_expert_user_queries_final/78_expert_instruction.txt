"""
        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            I have data of car named "78_h5_data.h5". The available datasets list is ['0-60 mph(sec)', 'Gas Mileage(mpg)', 'Power(kW)', 'Weight(kg)', 'Engine Displacement(cc)'].
Write a python code to draw a plot.
1. Type of Plot: This is a 3D scatter plot.

2. Axes Description:
   - The X-axis represents "0-60 mph (sec)".
   - The Y-axis represents "Gas Mileage (mpg)".
   - The Z-axis represents "Power (kW)".

3. Data Points:
   - Each data point in the 3D space represents a car, plotted according to its 0-60 mph time, gas mileage, and power.
   - The size of each point correlates positively with the engine displacement (cc) of the car. Larger points signify larger engine displacements.
   - The color of the points also represents engine displacement, using a gradient color scheme (like viridis), where one color end (like purple) indicates smaller displacement, and the other end (like yellow) indicates larger displacement.

4. Projections:
   - There are projections of these data points on three planes: XY, ZX, and YZ.
   - Each projection uses dots of a single color for all points on that plane.
   - The XY plane projection is at the bottom (below the main data points), colored blue.
   - The ZX plane projection is on one side, colored red.
   - The YZ plane projection is on another side, colored green.

5. Additional Elements:
   - A color bar is present, showing the correlation between color and engine displacement in cc.
   - The plot has labels for each axis, clearly stating what each axis represents.
   - The plot uses a 3D perspective, allowing the axes and projections to be viewed at an angle rather than straight on.

6. Style:
   - The plot should have a modern, clean look, with a focus on readability and clarity.
   - The scatter points are solid and well-defined, with a slightly transparent look to prevent overcrowding visually.

        Note: return only the the response of sub-queries only based on the below format, not explanation, not python code, and node additional text needed
        Return format:

        HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
        <generated sub-query>

        NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
        <generated sub-query>

        Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
        <generated sub-query>
        """

Here are the 3 sub-queries:

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
Access HDF5 file "78_h5_data.h5" using h5py, retrieve datasets ['0-60 mph(sec)', 'Gas Mileage(mpg)', 'Power(kW)', 'Weight(kg)', 'Engine Displacement(cc)'] and their metadata.

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
Handle _FillValue in NumPy arrays, apply masks to filter data, compute or filter data using min, max, and other preprocessing logic for datasets ['0-60 mph(sec)', 'Gas Mileage(mpg)', 'Power(kW)', 'Weight(kg)', 'Engine Displacement(cc)'].

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
Create a 3D scatter plot with matplotlib or mpl_toolkits.basemap using X-axis='0-60 mph (sec)', Y-axis='Gas Mileage (mpg)', Z-axis='Power (kW)', with point size correlated to 'Engine Displacement(cc)' and color representing 'Engine Displacement(cc)' using a gradient color scheme, including projections on XY, ZX, and YZ planes.
