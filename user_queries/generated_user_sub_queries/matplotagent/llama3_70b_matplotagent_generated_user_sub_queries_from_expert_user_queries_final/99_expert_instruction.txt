"""
        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            To create a violin plot using Seaborn, you should use data from a h5 file named "99_h5_data.h5" 
which includes datasets `total_bill`, `tip`, `sex`, `smoker`, `day`, `time`, and `size`. 
The plot should focus on comparing the 'Total_Bill' amounts for different 'Day' values (days of the week), 
with a distinction between 'smoker' and 'non-smoker' categories. Implement split violins for this purpose, 
and within each violin, use quartiles to represent the data distribution. The color scheme should be green for smokers and grey for non-smokers. Adopt a dark style theme for the plot.

        ---
        Note: return only the the response of sub-queries only based on the below format, not explanation, not python code, and node additional text needed
        Return format:

        HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
        <generated sub-query>

        NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
        <generated sub-query>

        Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
        <generated sub-query>
        """

Here are the 3 sub-queries:

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
Accessing HDF5 file "99_h5_data.h5" with h5py, reading datasets total_bill, tip, sex, smoker, day, time, and size.

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
Handling _FillValue in NumPy arrays, applying masks to filter data by smoker and non-smoker categories, computing quartiles for data distribution.

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
Creating a violin plot with Seaborn using total_bill data, distinguishing between smoker and non-smoker categories, adopting dark style theme, and customizing color scheme with green for smokers and grey for non-smokers.
