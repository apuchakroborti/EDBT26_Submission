"""
        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            Write a python script to draw the phase diagram of water with the provided data, named "84_h5_data.h5":
1. Prepare the Axes:
- Create a horizontal axis for temperature, marking one scale in Celsius (0°C to 100°C) and another in Kelvin (273.15 K to 647.396 K). 
    These scales should be aligned so that each temperature in Celsius matches its corresponding value in Kelvin.
- Create a vertical axis for pressure, marking one scale in Pascals (from 611.657 Pa to 22.064 MPa, possibly using a logarithmic scale for better visualization) 
    and another in bars and millibars. Align these scales so that, for example, 100 kPa corresponds with 1 bar.
- Set X1 to x1 - 273.15 to convert Kelvin to Celsius for the top X-axis. Set Y1 to y1/100000 to convert Pascals to bars for the right Y-axis. 
    Adjust the right Y-axis to have a Log10 scale type.
2. Plot the Phase Boundaries:
- Utilize datasets `Pressure(Gas)` and `Pressure(Liquid)` from your data to plot the boundary line between the solid, liquid, and gas phases, curving from the triple point to the critical point.
- Use datasets `Temperature(K)` and `Temperature(K).1` to plot the boundary between solid and liquid phases, which typically curves less dramatically than the solid-liquid-gas line.
3. Highlight Special Points:
- Mark the triple point at 273.16 K and 611.657 Pa, where solid, liquid, and gas coexist.
- Indicate the critical point at 647.396 K and 22.064 MPa, where the distinction between liquid and gas phases ends.
4. Insert Red Lines:
- Draw a vertical red line at 0°C and 273.15 K to represent the freezing point at 1 atm, intersecting the solid-liquid boundary.
- Add another vertical red line at 100°C and 373.15 K for the boiling point at 1 atm, intersecting the liquid-gas boundary.
5. Label and Color-Code:
- Clearly label each axis with its respective units.
- Color the different regions of the diagram to represent the solid (blue), liquid (green), and gas (yellow) phases.
- Annotate the diagram with the special points and the red lines, including their corresponding temperature and pressure values.
6. Grid and Scale:
- It may be helpful to include a grid to accurately read off pressures and temperatures at various points on the diagram.
- Ensure that the scale is logarithmic for pressure if you are spanning wide ranges, as phase diagrams often do.

        Note: return only the the response of sub-queries only based on the below format, not explanation, not python code, and node additional text needed
        Return format:

Here are the 3 sub-queries:

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
Access HDF5 file "84_h5_data.h5" using h5py, retrieve datasets "Pressure(Gas)" and "Pressure(Liquid)", and attributes "Temperature(K)" and "Temperature(K).1".

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
Handle _FillValue in NumPy arrays, apply masks to filter data, compute temperature values in Celsius from Kelvin, and convert pressure values from Pascals to bars.

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
Use matplotlib or cartopy to create a phase diagram with aligned axes for temperature (Celsius and Kelvin) and pressure (Pascals, bars, and millibars), plot boundary lines between phases, highlight special points, and add red lines and color-coded regions.
