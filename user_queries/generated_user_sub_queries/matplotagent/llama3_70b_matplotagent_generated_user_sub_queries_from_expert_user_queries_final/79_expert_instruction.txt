"""
        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            I have a h5 data of iris flower named "79_h5_data.h5". The list of datasets is ['Petal Length(cm)', 'Petal Width(cm)', 'Sepal Length(cm)', 'Sepal Width(cm)', 'Species'].
Write a python code to draw a plot.
1. Create a 3D scatter plot with axes representing 'Petal Length', 'Petal-Width', and 'Sepal Length'.
2. Plot data points for each iris flower species using distinct colors.
3. For each species, calculate the mean of the data points to determine the ellipsoid center.
4. Compute the covariance matrix for each species to define the ellipsoid shape and orientation.
5. Scale the ellipsoids to include 95% of the respective data points, ensuring they are aligned with the dataset's principal variation axes.
6. Draw solid, opaque ellipsoids for each species in matching colors to the scatter points, without wireframes.
7. Add axis labels for each measurement dimension and a legend that identifies each species by color.

        Note: return only the the response of sub-queries only based on the below format, not explanation, not python code, and node additional text needed
        Return format:

        HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
        <generated sub-query>

        NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
        <generated sub-query>

        Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:

        """

Here are the 3 sub-queries:

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
Access HDF5 file "79_h5_data.h5" using h5py, retrieve datasets ['Petal Length(cm)', 'Petal Width(cm)', 'Sepal Length(cm)'] and metadata.

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
Handle _FillValue in NumPy arrays, apply masks to filter data points for each iris flower species, compute mean of data points for each species, calculate covariance matrix for each species.

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
Create 3D scatter plot with axes representing 'Petal Length', 'Petal Width', and 'Sepal Length' using matplotlib or cartopy, draw solid ellipsoids for each species in matching colors to the scatter points, add axis labels and legend that identifies each species by color.
