"""
        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            I want a polar coordinate diagram to visualize the highest temperature data in Amherst on the first of each month, spanning from January 1, 2004, to August 1, 2015. The data is named "95_h5_data.h5". 
The data contains three datasets: `Year`, `Date`, and `Temperature` 
Here are My specific requirements for the visualization:
- The diagram should be divided into 12 sectors, corresponding to the months of the year.
- Temperature data should be plotted on the diagram according to the month.
- The points representing the temperature data should be circular.
- These points should be slightly offset so as not to align on a single radial line, with each point for the 1st of a month positioned between that month and the next. The offset should range from 0 to π/6 radians.
- Month labels should be abbreviated (Jan, Feb, Mar, etc.) instead of numerical (1, 2, 3, etc.).
- A blue curve should connect the data points for the year 2015 to distinguish it from other years.
- The legend should be moved to the right to avoid overlapping the diagram.
The diagram will serve as a clear visual representation of temperature trends and variations by month over several years, with particular emphasis on the data from 2015.

        Note: return only the the response of sub-queries only based on the below format, not explanation, not python code, and node additional text needed
        Return format:

Here are the generated sub-queries:

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
Access HDF5 file "95_h5_data.h5" using h5py, retrieve datasets "Year", "Date", and "Temperature", and extract metadata.

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
Filter temperature data for highest values on the 1st of each month from January 1, 2004, to August 1, 2015, handling _FillValue and applying masks using NumPy.

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
Create a polar coordinate diagram with matplotlib or cartopy, dividing it into 12 sectors for months, plotting temperature data as circular points with offset, adding month labels, a blue curve for 2015 data, and moving the legend to the right.
