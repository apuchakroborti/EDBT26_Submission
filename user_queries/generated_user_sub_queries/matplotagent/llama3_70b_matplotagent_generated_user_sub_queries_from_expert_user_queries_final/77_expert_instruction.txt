"""
        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            I have data of protein consumption in 24 European countries named "77_h5_data.h5". 
The datasets are ["Country", "Red Meat", "White Meat", "Eggs", "Milk", "Fish", "Cereals", "Starch", "Nuts", "Fruits and Vegetables"].
Write a python code to create an image of a 2D scatter plot representing a K-Means clustering of data. 
The plot should have three distinct clusters of points, each in its own color. 
For example, Cluster 0 could be blue, Cluster 1 could be red, and Cluster 2 could be green. 
Around each cluster, draw a semi-transparent ellipse in the same color as the cluster points but in a lighter shade, giving a sense of grouping. 
Connect each data point to the centroid of its cluster with a thick grey line. The background should have a grid, enhancing the plot's readability. 
Label the x-axis as 'Principal Component 1' and the y-axis as 'Principal Component 2'. 
Annotate each data point with a small text label close to it, which could be the names of countries for a realistic touch, but ensure the text is legible. 
The plot should have a title at the top: 'K-Means Clustering with PCA-reduced Data and Colored Ellipses'. 
Include a legend on the side, denoting the clusters with their respective colors.   

        ---
        Note: return only the the response of sub-queries only based on the below format, not explanation, not python code, and node additional text needed
        Return format:

        HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
        <generated sub-query>

        NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
        <generated sub-query>

        Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
        <generated sub-query>
        """

Here are the 3 sub-queries:

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
Access HDF5 file "77_h5_data.h5" using h5py, read datasets ["Country", "Red Meat", "White Meat", "Eggs", "Milk", "Fish", "Cereals", "Starch", "Nuts", "Fruits and Vegetables"].

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
Apply PCA reduction to dataset, handle _FillValue, mask missing values using np.where or np.ma.masked_where, compute K-Means clustering with 3 clusters.

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
Create a 2D scatter plot using matplotlib or cartopy, visualize K-Means clustering results with colored points and semi-transparent ellipses, add grid background, annotate data points with country names, include legend and title.
