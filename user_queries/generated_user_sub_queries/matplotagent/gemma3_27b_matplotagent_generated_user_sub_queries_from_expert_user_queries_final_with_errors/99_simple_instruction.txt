"""
        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            Create a dark-themed violin plot to compare the total bill amounts by day of the week from a h5 file named "99_h5_data.h5" which includes datasets "total_bill", "tip", "Sex", "Smoker", "day", "time", and "size". The plot should clearly distinguish between smokers and non-smokers using a green color for smokers and grey for non-smokers. Include split violins to show this distinction, and make sure the plot represents data quartiles inside each violin.

        Note: return only the the response of sub-queries only based on the below format, not explanation, not python code, and node additional text needed
        Return format:

        HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
        <generated sub-query>

        NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:

        Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:

        """

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
How to access the "total_bill" and "Smoker" datasets from an h5 file using `h5py`, including retrieving the data as NumPy arrays.

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
How to group "total_bill" data by unique values in the "Smoker" dataset using NumPy, and how to handle potential missing or fill values within the "total_bill" dataset.

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
How to create a split violin plot using `matplotlib` to compare distributions of "total_bill" for different "Smoker" groups, customize the plot with a dark theme, specify colors (green for smokers, grey for non-smokers), and display quartiles within each violin.
