"""
        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            Write a code to read h5 data named '76_h5_data.h5' and visualize the "women's millions of dollars" dataset with a composite graph: an axis-free box plot above and a histogram below. Label key statistics on the box plot and detail the frequency distribution in the histogram. Highlight quartiles with continuous red dashed lines across both sections, ensuring no breaks.

        ---
        Note: return only the the response of sub-queries only based on the below format, not explanation, not python code, and node additional text needed
        Return format:

        HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
        <generated sub-query>

        NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
        <generated sub-query>

        Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:

        """

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
How to open and read a specific dataset (e.g., "women's millions of dollars") from an HDF5 file using `h5py`, including accessing the dataset path and any associated attributes or metadata.

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
How to handle potential `_FillValue` within a NumPy array loaded from an HDF5 file, and how to apply masking techniques (e.g., `np.ma.masked_where`) to exclude these values from subsequent calculations or visualizations.

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
How to create a composite plot using `matplotlib` with a box plot above a histogram, configure axis-free box plot, draw continuous red dashed lines across both sections to highlight quartiles, and add appropriate labels, titles, and colorbars.
