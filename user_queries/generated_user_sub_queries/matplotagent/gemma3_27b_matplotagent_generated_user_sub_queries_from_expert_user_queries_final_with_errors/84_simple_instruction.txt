"""
        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            I want to create a phase diagram of water using Python. The data is in a file called '84_h5_data.h5'.

- First, you should set up the chart with a horizontal axis for temperature and a vertical axis for pressure. These should be marked in Celsius, Kelvin, Pascals, bars and millibars, with conversions where necessary.
- Next, you should use the data to draw the lines that separate the solid, liquid, and gas phases of water. Use datasets Pressure(gas) and Pressure(liquid) of data to draw the line that separates the solid, liquid, and gas phases. Use datasets  temperature(K) and temperature(K).1 to draw the line that separates the solid and liquid phases.
- You should also mark two special points: the triple point at 273.16 K and 611.657 Pa, where solid, liquid, and gas coexist, and the critical point at 647.396 K and 22.064 MPa, where there's no difference between liquid and gas.
- You should draw two vertical red lines to show the freezing and boiling points of water at normal pressure.
- Make sure to label everything clearly, and color the different regions to show the solid, liquid, and gas phases.
- Finally, you should add a grid to make the chart easier to read, and ensure the pressure scale is logarithmic, since phase diagrams often cover a wide range of pressures.

        """

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
How to access specific datasets (e.g., 'Pressure(gas)', 'Pressure(liquid)', 'temperature(K)', 'temperature(K).1') within an h5py-opened HDF5 file ('84_h5_data.h5'), and retrieve their data as NumPy arrays. Also, how to read dataset metadata or attributes associated with these datasets.

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
How to handle potential `_FillValue` within the NumPy arrays obtained from the HDF5 file, and how to mask or replace these values. How to use NumPy functions (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`) to filter or modify the data based on specific conditions, and how to compute min/max values for data validation.

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
How to create a phase diagram using `matplotlib`, including setting up logarithmic scales for the pressure axis, configuring appropriate projections, drawing lines based on data from NumPy arrays, adding vertical lines at specific x-values, coloring regions based on data values, adding gridlines, and labeling axes with units (Celsius, Kelvin, Pascals, bars, millibars). Also, how to add and customize markers for the triple point and critical point.
