"""
        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            Utilize the following datasets from '87_h5_data.h5' to create a sunburst plot:
- 'country': for the names of the countries,
- 'continent': to indicate which continent each country is in,
- 'lifeExp': showing the expected lifespan in each country,
- 'pop': representing the population of each country.
Your chart should:
- Organize the data hierarchically, starting with continents and then breaking down into countries.
- Use the population of each country to determine the size of its segment in the chart.
- Color code each segment by the country's expected lifespan, transitioning from red to blue across the range of values.
- Set the central value of the color scale to the average lifespan, weighted by the population of the countries.
- Finally, include a legend to help interpret the lifespan values as indicated by the color coding.

        Note: return only the the response of sub-queries only based on the below format, not explanation, not python code, and node additional text needed
        Return format:

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
How to access datasets within an HDF5 file using `h5py`, specifically reading data from datasets named 'country', 'continent', 'lifeExp', and 'pop' from the file '87_h5_data.h5'. Also, how to retrieve dataset paths and metadata associated with these datasets.

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
How to handle potential `_FillValue` within the 'lifeExp' and 'pop' datasets, and how to use NumPy to compute the weighted average of 'lifeExp' based on 'pop' as the weights.

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
How to create a sunburst plot using `matplotlib` or a similar library, organizing data hierarchically (continent -> country), sizing segments by population ('pop'), and color-coding segments by lifespan ('lifeExp') with a diverging color scale centered on the weighted average lifespan. How to add a legend to the plot to interpret the color coding.
