"""
        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            Create a combination chart from the "96_h5_data.h5" dataset, which contains sales data for various mobile phone brands across different quarters of the year. The datasets in the h5 file are ["Quarter", "Samsung", "Nokia/Microsoft", "Apple", "LG", "ZTE", "Huawei"]. For each brand, create a box plot to represent the distribution of their sales data. On each box plot, display all the individual sales data points for that brand. Additionally, calculate the average sales for each brand and draw a line connecting these average values across the box plots. Use a consistent color scheme for the same quarter across different years, varying the shades to distinguish between years. Include a legend to aid in understanding the color coding.

        Note: return only the the response of sub-queries only based on the below format, not explanation, not python code, and node additional text needed
        Return format:

        """

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
How to open and read datasets from an HDF5 file using `h5py`, specifically accessing datasets by name (e.g., "Quarter", "Samsung") and retrieving the data they contain. How to determine the structure and paths within the HDF5 file.

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
How to handle potential `_FillValue` in NumPy arrays read from the HDF5 file, and how to mask or replace these values. How to calculate the mean of NumPy arrays and filter data based on certain conditions.

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
How to create box plots and overlay individual data points using `matplotlib`. How to draw lines connecting average values across multiple box plots. How to configure color schemes for different quarters and years, and how to create a legend to explain the color coding. How to set plot titles and labels.
