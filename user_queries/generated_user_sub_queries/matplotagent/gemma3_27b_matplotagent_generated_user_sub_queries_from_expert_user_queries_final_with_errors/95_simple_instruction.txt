"""
        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            Create a polar coordinate diagram using data from "95_h5_data.h5" to display the highest temperatures on the first of each month in Amherst, spanning from January 1, 2004, to August 1, 2015. The data includes datasets labeled "Year," "Date," and "Temperature." The diagram should include:

- 12 sectors, each representing a month of the year.
- Temperature data plotted according to the corresponding month.
- Circular points for the temperature data, slightly offset to prevent alignment along a single radial line.
- Abbreviated labels for the months (Jan, Feb, Mar, etc.).
- A blue curve that connects the data points from the year 2015.
- A legend positioned on the right side of the diagram.
- A title: "Monthly Highest Temperature in Amherst (2004-2015)."
The purpose of the diagram is to clearly illustrate the temperature trends and monthly variations over the years, with an emphasis on the data from 2015.

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
How to use `h5py` to open a file with extension `.h5` and access datasets named "Year", "Date", and "Temperature". How to retrieve data based on specific date ranges (January 1, 2004, to August 1, 2015) and extract the maximum temperature for each month. How to access dataset paths within the HDF5 file.

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
How to use NumPy to find the maximum temperature for each month from the "Temperature" dataset. How to handle potential `_FillValue` in the "Temperature" dataset and mask or exclude these values. How to filter data based on the "Date" and "Year" datasets to isolate monthly maximum temperatures.

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
How to create a polar coordinate plot using `matplotlib` with 12 sectors representing months. How to plot circular points in each sector representing monthly maximum temperatures, with slight offsets. How to label each sector with abbreviated month names (Jan, Feb, Mar, etc.). How to draw a blue curve connecting the temperature data points for the year 2015. How to add a legend and title ("Monthly Highest Temperature in Amherst (2004-2015)") to the plot, and position the legend on the right side.
