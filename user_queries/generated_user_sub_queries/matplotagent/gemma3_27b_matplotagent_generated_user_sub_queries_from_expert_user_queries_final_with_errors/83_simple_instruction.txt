"""
        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            I want to create a line chart of the Dow Jones Industrial Average from October 2006 to August 2013 using Python. The data is in '83_h5_data.h5' with dataset "Date", "Dow Jones Industrial Average" and "1 Year moving average". Write a Python code to read the data and draw two lines on the chart. You should also color the area between the lines based on certain rules. Then add a title, labels, and a legend, and make sure the dates are readable.

        ---
        Note: return only the the response of sub-queries only based on the below format, not explanation, not python code, and node additional text needed
        Return format:

        HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
        <generated sub-query>

        NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
        <generated sub-query>

        Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
        <generated sub-query>
        """

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
How to use `h5py` to open a `.h5` file, access datasets by name (e.g., "Date", "Dow Jones Industrial Average", "1 Year moving average"), and retrieve data as NumPy arrays. How to read dataset paths within the HDF5 file.

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
How to handle potential `_FillValue` in NumPy arrays read from the HDF5 file, and how to mask or replace these values. How to use NumPy to filter or compute data based on conditions.

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
How to use `matplotlib` to create a line chart with two lines, customize line colors, fill the area between the lines, add a title, axis labels, a legend, and format date labels for readability.
