"""
        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            Create two ternary phase diagrams from the dataset "97_h5_data.h5", containing 'No.', 'IL (25°C)', 'toluene (25°C)', and 'n-heptane (25°C)'. Each same index data from each datasets indicates a mixture composition of these components at 25°C, with 'No.' indicating different groups or conditions.

For both diagrams:
- Title: "Liquid-Liquid Phase Diagram".

1. Equilateral Triangle Diagram:
  - Plot with 'toluene' at the top, 'n-heptane' at the bottom left, and 'IL' at the bottom right.
  - Transform component fractions to Cartesian coordinates for an equilateral layout.
  - Plot data points as circles, connect same 'No.' group points with dashed lines, and use different colors for each group.
  - Label each vertex with the component name and draw borders for the triangle and remove axis ticks and labels for a clean look.
2. Right-Angled Triangle Diagram:
  - Plot with 'IL' on the vertical axis, 'toluene' on the horizontal axis, right angle at the bottom left.
  - Transform for a right-angled layout, similarly plot and connect points, using the same color scheme.
  - Label axes with 'IL' and 'toluene', and draw borders for the triangle and remove axis ticks and labels for a clean look.
Display both diagrams side-by-side, maintaining an equal aspect ratio for comparison.

        Note: return only the the response of sub-queries only based on the below format, not explanation, not python code, and node additional text needed
        Return format:

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
How to use `h5py` to open a file with extension `.h5` and access datasets by name (e.g., 'No.', 'IL (25°C)', 'toluene (25°C)', 'n-heptane (25°C)')? How to read the data from these datasets as NumPy arrays?

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
How to handle potential `_FillValue` in NumPy arrays read from the HDF5 file? How to use NumPy's masking capabilities (`np.ma.masked_where`) to exclude invalid data points? How to perform element-wise operations on NumPy arrays?

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
How to create ternary diagrams using `matplotlib`? How to transform component fractions into Cartesian coordinates for equilateral and right-angled triangle layouts? How to customize plot appearance (titles, axis labels, borders, ticks, colors, line styles) and display multiple plots side-by-side with equal aspect ratios? How to use `matplotlib` to draw lines connecting data points with specific styles (dashed lines)?
