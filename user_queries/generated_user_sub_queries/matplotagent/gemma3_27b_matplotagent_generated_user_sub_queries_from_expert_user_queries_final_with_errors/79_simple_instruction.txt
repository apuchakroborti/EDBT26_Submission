"""
        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            I have data of iris flower named "79_h5_data.h5". Generate a 3D scatter plot from "79_h5_data.h5" using the datasets "Petal Length(cm)", "Petal width(cm)", "Sepal Length(cm)", and "Species". Use distinct colors to represent each iris flower species. For each species, include confidence ellipses that encompass 95% of the data points, ensuring these ellipses are aligned with the principal axes of variation in the dataset. The confidence ellipses should be solid, opaque, and color-matched to the scatter points of each species, without any wireframes. Ensure the plot includes labeled axes for 'Petal Length', 'Petal Width', and 'Sepal Length', and add a legend that clearly identifies each species by its corresponding color.

        Note: return only the the response of sub-queries only based on the below format, not explanation, not python code, and node additional text needed
        Return format:

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
How to access specific datasets ("Petal Length(cm)", "Petal width(cm)", "Sepal Length(cm)", "Species") from an HDF5 file using `h5py`, including retrieving dataset paths and handling potential missing datasets.

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
How to handle potential `_FillValue` in NumPy arrays loaded from the HDF5 file, and how to filter or select data based on species labels using NumPy array indexing or masking.

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
How to create a 3D scatter plot using `matplotlib`, configure axes labels ('Petal Length', 'Petal Width', 'Sepal Length'), apply distinct colors to data points based on species, and draw solid, opaque confidence ellipses representing 95% confidence intervals aligned with principal axes, including adding a legend to identify each species by its color.
