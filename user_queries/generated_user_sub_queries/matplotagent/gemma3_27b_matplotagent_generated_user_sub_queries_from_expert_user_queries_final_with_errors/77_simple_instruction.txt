"""
        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            I have data of protein consumption in 24 European countries named "77_h5_data.h5". The datasets are ["Country","Red Meat","White Meat","eggs","milk","Fish","Cereals","Starch","Nut","Fruits & Vegetables"].
Write a Python code to visualize this data using a 2D scatter plot with K-Means clustering into three distinct color-coded clusters. The plot should include semi-transparent ellipses around each cluster, lines connecting data points to cluster centroids, and annotations for each point representing countries. It should be well-labeled and include a legend, aiming for clarity and visual grouping.

        Note: return only the the response of sub-queries only based on the below format, not explanation, not python code, and node additional text needed
        Return format:

        HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
        <generated sub-query>

        NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
        <generated sub-query>

        Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
        <generated sub-query>
        """

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
How to open and read datasets from an HDF5 file using `h5py`, specifically accessing datasets by name (e.g., "Country", "Red Meat") and retrieving data as NumPy arrays.

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
How to handle potential `_FillValue` in NumPy arrays, and how to apply masking techniques (e.g., `np.ma.masked_where`) to exclude invalid or missing data before performing calculations or clustering.

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
How to create a 2D scatter plot using `matplotlib`, implement K-Means clustering, draw semi-transparent ellipses around clusters, connect data points to cluster centroids, add annotations to points, and configure plot labels, legends, and titles for clear visualization.
