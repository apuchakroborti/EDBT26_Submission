"""
        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            Create two ternary phase diagrams using the provided dataset named "97_h5_data.h5". 
The dataset contains datasets 'SL_NO.', 'IL (25°C)', 'toluene (25°C)', and 'n-heptane (25°C)', 
where each row represents a unique mixture composition of these three components at 25°C. The 'SL_NO' dataset categorizes the data into different groups or experimental conditions.

For both diagrams:
- Title: "Liquid-Liquid Phase Diagram".

Equilateral Triangle Diagram:

- Plot an equilateral triangle ternary diagram.
- Position 'toluene' at the top vertex, 'n-heptane' at the bottom left vertex, and 'IL' at the bottom right vertex.
- Convert the component fractions to Cartesian coordinates suitable for an equilateral triangle layout.
- Plot each data point as a circle and connect points within the same 'No.' group with dashed lines.
- Use different colors for each 'No.' group and add a legend to distinguish these groups.
- Label each vertex of the triangle with the corresponding component name.
- Draw borders for the triangle and remove axis ticks and labels for a clean look.

Right-Angled Triangle Diagram:

- Plot a right-angled triangle ternary diagram.
- Position 'IL' on the vertical axis, 'toluene' on the horizontal axis, and have the right angle at the bottom left corner.
- Convert the component fractions to Cartesian coordinates suitable for a right-angled triangle layout.
- Plot each data point as a circle and connect points within the same 'No.' group with dashed lines.
- Use the same color scheme as the equilateral diagram for consistency, and include a legend.
- Label the vertical and horizontal axes with 'IL' and 'toluene' respectively.
- Draw borders for the triangle and remove axis ticks and labels for a clean look.
Ensure both diagrams are plotted side-by-side for easy comparison, and maintain an equal aspect ratio for both diagrams.
