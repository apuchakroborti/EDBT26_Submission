"""
        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            Use 87_h5_data.h5 to plot a sunburst chart.
- The hierarchy is defined by the 'continent' and 'country' datasets.
- The size of each segment is determined by the 'pop' dataset (population).
- The color of each segment is determined by the 'lifeExp' datasets (life expectancy).
- The color scale is a diverging scale that goes from red to blue ('RdBu').
- The midpoint of the color scale is the weighted average of the 'lifeExp' values, with the weights being the 'pop' values.
- Add A color bar as a legend for the 'lifeExp' dataset.

        Note: return only the the response of sub-queries only based on the below format, not explanation, not python code, and node additional text needed
        Return format:

        HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
        <generated sub-query>

        NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
How to access datasets 'continent', 'country', 'pop', and 'lifeExp' from an HDF5 file using `h5py`, including retrieving their data as NumPy arrays and understanding the file structure/dataset paths.

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
How to compute a weighted average using NumPy, given 'lifeExp' values and 'pop' values as weights. How to handle potential missing or fill values (`_FillValue`) within the 'lifeExp' and 'pop' datasets before calculating the weighted average.

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
How to create a sunburst chart using `matplotlib` or a similar library, where segment sizes are determined by data values, segment colors are determined by data values, and a diverging color map ('RdBu') is applied with a custom midpoint. How to add a colorbar to represent the 'lifeExp' values and serve as a legend.
