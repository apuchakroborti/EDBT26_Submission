"""
        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            I have a h5 data of iris flower named "79_h5_data.h5". The list of datasets is ['Petal Length(cm)', 'Petal Width(cm)', 'Sepal Length(cm)', 'Sepal Width(cm)', 'Species'].
Write a python code to draw a plot.
1. Create a 3D scatter plot with axes representing 'Petal Length', 'Petal-Width', and 'Sepal Length'.
2. Plot data points for each iris flower species using distinct colors.
3. For each species, calculate the mean of the data points to determine the ellipsoid center.
4. Compute the covariance matrix for each species to define the ellipsoid shape and orientation.
5. Scale the ellipsoids to include 95% of the respective data points, ensuring they are aligned with the dataset's principal variation axes.
6. Draw solid, opaque ellipsoids for each species in matching colors to the scatter points, without wireframes.
7. Add axis labels for each measurement dimension and a legend that identifies each species by color.
