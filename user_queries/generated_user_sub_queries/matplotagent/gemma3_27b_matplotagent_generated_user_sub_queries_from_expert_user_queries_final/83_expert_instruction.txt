"""
        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            I want to plot a line graph of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) from October 2006 to August 2013.
The data is in '83_h5_data.h5'
The data contains three datasets:
    `date`: The date of the record.
    `Dow Jones Industrial Average`: The daily closing value of the DJIA.
    `1 year Moving Average`: The 1-year moving average value of the DJIA.
With this data, you can plot the line graph using Python. Here's how you can do it:

- Read the data from the h5 file using h5py.
- Convert the date datasets values to datetime for proper plotting.
- Plot the daily DJIA values and the 1-year moving average as lines on the graph.
- Fill the area between the lines with the appropriate colors using the fill_between method.
- Set the title of the graph and labels for the X and Y axes.
- Adjust the X-axis to display the dates in a readable format.
- Add a legend to the graph.

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
How to access datasets within an HDF5 file using `h5py`, specifically retrieving data from datasets named 'date', 'Dow Jones Industrial Average', and '1 year Moving Average' given a file path like '83_h5_data.h5'.

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
How to convert a NumPy array of date values (potentially in a numerical format) to datetime objects for plotting, and how to handle potential missing or invalid data within the 'Dow Jones Industrial Average' and '1 year Moving Average' datasets.

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
How to create a line plot using `matplotlib` showing two time series, 'Dow Jones Industrial Average' and '1 year Moving Average', with appropriate axis labels, title, legend, date formatting on the x-axis, and filled area between the two lines.
