"""
        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            I Have some data of Clothing Stores Retail Sales in U.S.A named in h5 format named '76_h5_data.h5'. 
There are two datasets in the .h5 file. The first dataset is "Womans Millions of dollars". the second dataset is "Mens millions of Dollars". 
Write a python script to read data from file "76_h5_data.h5" and create a vertical two-part graph with the top part being a box plot and the bottom part a histogram. 
The data visualized relates to 'Womens millions of dollars' in retail sales. The plot showcase the distribution of women's clothing retail sales in the U.S. 
The upper section is an axis-free box plot highlighting key statistical values, while the lower section is a histogram detailing the frequency distribution. 
Red dashed lines indicate the quartiles, seamlessly connecting both plots to emphasize these measures.The box plot should have no visible axes, and it should be narrower in width. 
Include numerical labels for key statistics such as the minimum, lower quartile, median, upper quartile, and maximum values, placed just above the box plot. 
The histogram should have visible axes and a smaller bin size for finer details. Add two continuous red dashed lines at the lower and upper quartiles. 
These lines should extend seamlessly across both the box plot and the histogram, without any gaps. 
The entire plot should be tightly laid out with no space between the box plot and the histogram so that the line can have no break.

        Note: return only the the response of sub-queries only based on the below format, not explanation, not python code, and node additional text needed
        Return format:

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
How to open an HDF5 file using `h5py`, access a specific dataset by name (e.g., "Womans Millions of dollars"), and read all data from that dataset into a NumPy array.

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
How to calculate the minimum, maximum, first quartile, median, and third quartile of a NumPy array. How to use these values to define dashed lines for plotting.

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
How to create a two-panel vertical plot using `matplotlib`, with a box plot in the top panel and a histogram in the bottom panel. How to remove axes from the box plot, adjust the width of the box plot, and add a smaller bin size to the histogram. How to draw continuous dashed lines across both plots at specified quartile values, ensuring no gaps between the plots.
