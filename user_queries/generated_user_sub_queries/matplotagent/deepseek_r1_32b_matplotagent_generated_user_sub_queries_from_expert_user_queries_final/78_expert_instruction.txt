        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            I have data of car named "78_h5_data.h5". The available datasets list is ['0-60 mph(sec)', 'Gas Mileage(mpg)', 'Power(kW)', 'Weight(kg)', 'Engine Displacement(cc)'].
Write a python code to draw a plot.
1. Type of Plot: This is a 3D scatter plot.

2. Axes Description:
   - The X-axis represents "0-60 mph (sec)".
   - The Y-axis represents "Gas Mileage (mpg)".
   - The Z-axis represents "Power (kW)".

3. Data Points:
   - Each data point in the 3D space represents a car, plotted according to its 0-60 mph time, gas mileage, and power.
   - The size of each point correlates positively with the engine displacement (cc) of the car. Larger points signify larger engine displacements.
   - The color of the points also represents engine displacement, using a gradient color scheme (like viridis), where one color end (like purple) indicates smaller displacement, and the other end (like yellow) indicates larger displacement.

4. Projections:
   - There are projections of these data points on three planes: XY, ZX, and YZ.
   - Each projection uses dots of a single color for all points on that plane.
   - The XY plane projection is at the bottom (below the main data points), colored blue.
   - The ZX plane projection is on one side, colored red.
   - The YZ plane projection is on another side, colored green.

5. Additional Elements:
   - A color bar is present, showing the correlation between color and engine displacement in cc.
   - The plot has labels for each axis, clearly stating what each axis represents.
   - The plot uses a 3D perspective, allowing the axes and projections to be viewed at an angle rather than straight on.

6. Style:
   - The plot should have a modern, clean look, with a focus on readability and clarity.
   - The scatter points are solid and well-defined, with a slightly transparent look to prevent overcrowding visually.

        Note: return only the the response of sub-queries only based on the below format, not explanation, not python code, and node additional text needed

Alright, I need to break down the user's query into three specific sub-queries as per their instructions. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, the HDF5 Dataset Access. The user has a file named "78_h5_data.h5" and needs to access several datasets: '0-60 mph(sec)', 'Gas Mileage(mpg)', 'Power(kW)', 'Weight(kg)', and 'Engine Displacement(cc)'. So I should focus on how to use h5py to open the file, read each dataset by its path, and retrieve their metadata if needed.

Next, for NumPy-based Data Preprocessing. The user wants to handle any _FillValue in the datasets. They also need to create a mask or filter data points based on certain conditions using np.where or similar functions. Additionally, they want to compute variables like engine displacement for scaling point sizes and colors in the plot.

Lastly, the Plotting and Visualization part. This involves creating a 3D scatter plot with specific axes and projections. I need to use matplotlib's 3D capabilities, set up the projections on XY, ZX, and YZ planes with different colors, add a colorbar for engine displacement, ensure proper axis labels, and apply a modern style for clarity.

I should make sure each sub-query is clear and targets only its specific domain without overlapping information.

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
How to access the datasets '0-60 mph(sec)', 'Gas Mileage(mpg)', 'Power(kW)', 'Weight(kg)', and 'Engine Displacement(cc)' from an HDF5 file named "78_h5_data.h5" using h5py, including their metadata.

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
How to handle _FillValue in NumPy arrays, apply masks using np.where or np.ma.masked_where, and compute variables for point size and color based on engine displacement(cc).

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
How to create a 3D scatter plot with projections on XY, ZX, and YZ planes using matplotlib, set point sizes and colors based on engine displacement, add a colorbar, and configure axis labels and style.
