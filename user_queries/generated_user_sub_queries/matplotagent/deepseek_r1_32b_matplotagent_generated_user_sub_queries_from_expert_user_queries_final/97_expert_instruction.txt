        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            Create two ternary phase diagrams using the provided dataset named "97_h5_data.h5". 
The dataset contains datasets 'SL_NO.', 'IL (25°C)', 'toluene (25°C)', and 'n-heptane (25°C)', 
where each row represents a unique mixture composition of these three components at 25°C. The 'SL_NO' dataset categorizes the data into different groups or experimental conditions.

For both diagrams:
- Title: "Liquid-Liquid Phase Diagram".

Equilateral Triangle Diagram:

- Plot an equilateral triangle ternary diagram.
- Position 'toluene' at the top vertex, 'n-heptane' at the bottom left vertex, and 'IL' at the bottom right vertex.
- Convert the component fractions to Cartesian coordinates suitable for an equilateral triangle layout.
- Plot each data point as a circle and connect points within the same 'No.' group with dashed lines.
- Use different colors for each 'No.' group and add a legend to distinguish these groups.
- Label each vertex of the triangle with the corresponding component name.
- Draw borders for the triangle and remove axis ticks and labels for a clean look.

Right-Angled Triangle Diagram:

- Plot a right-angled triangle ternary diagram.
- Position 'IL' on the vertical axis, 'toluene' on the horizontal axis, and have the right angle at the bottom left corner.
- Convert the component fractions to Cartesian coordinates suitable for a right-angled triangle layout.
- Plot each data point as a circle and connect points within the same 'No.' group with dashed lines.
- Use the same color scheme as the equilateral diagram for consistency, and include a legend.
- Label the vertical and horizontal axes with 'IL' and 'toluene' respectively.
- Draw borders for the triangle and remove axis ticks and labels for a clean look.
Ensure both diagrams are plotted side-by-side for easy comparison, and maintain an equal aspect ratio for both diagrams.

Alright, I need to break down the user's query into three specific sub-queries as per the guidelines. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, the HDF5 Dataset Access. The user is working with a file named "97_h5_data.h5" and needs to access several datasets: 'SL_NO.', 'IL (25°C)', 'toluene (25°C)', and 'n-heptane (25°C)'. They also mentioned that each row represents a mixture composition, so I should include how to read these datasets using h5py. Additionally, since the data is categorized by 'SL_NO.', accessing metadata related to this might be necessary.

Next, for NumPy-based Data Preprocessing, the main tasks are handling _FillValue and converting component fractions into Cartesian coordinates for both ternary diagrams. The user wants to plot points and connect them within the same group, so preprocessing steps like masking invalid data (using _FillValue) and coordinate conversion are essential here.

Lastly, the Plotting and Visualization part involves creating two ternary diagrams side-by-side using matplotlib. I need to specify how to set up both equilateral and right-angled triangles, including positioning components at specific vertices, labeling them, adding legends, and ensuring a clean look by removing ticks and labels. Also, maintaining equal aspect ratios for comparison is important.

I should make sure each sub-query is focused on its respective domain without overlapping with others.
