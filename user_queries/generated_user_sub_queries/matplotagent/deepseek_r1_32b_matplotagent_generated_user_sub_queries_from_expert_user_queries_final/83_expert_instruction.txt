"""
        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            I want to plot a line graph of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) from October 2006 to August 2013.
The data is in '83_h5_data.h5'
The data contains three datasets:
    `date`: The date of the record.
    `Dow Jones Industrial Average`: The daily closing value of the DJIA.
    `1 year Moving Average`: The 1-year moving average value of the DJIA.
With this data, you can plot the line graph using Python. Here's how you can do it:

- Read the data from the h5 file using h5py.
- Convert the date datasets values to datetime for proper plotting.
- Plot the daily DJIA values and the 1-year moving average as lines on the graph.
- Fill the area between the lines with the appropriate colors using the fill_between method.
- Set the title of the graph and labels for the X and Y axes.
- Adjust the X-axis to display the dates in a readable format.
- Add a legend to the graph.

Alright, I need to break down the user's query into three specific sub-queries as per the guidelines. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, the HDF5 Dataset Access. The user mentioned they have a file named '83_h5_data.h5' which contains datasets like date, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and 1 year Moving Average. So I should focus on how to access these specific datasets using h5py. That means opening the file, accessing each dataset by name, and retrieving their data.

Next, NumPy-based Data Preprocessing. The user needs to convert dates from the dataset into datetime objects for plotting. Also, they want to plot two lines: DJIA and its moving average. So I should think about how to handle any fill values that might be present in the data using NumPy functions like np.where or masked arrays. Additionally, preparing the data for plotting by ensuring it's in the correct format is important here.

Lastly, Map Plotting and Visualization. The user wants a line graph with two lines filled between them. They also mentioned setting titles, labels, adjusting date formatting on the X-axis, and adding a legend. So I need to focus on using matplotlib to plot these lines, fill the area between them, format the dates properly, and add all necessary labels and legends for clarity.

Putting it all together, each sub-query should address one of these areas without overlapping into others. That way, when someone uses these sub-queries with a vector database, they can find relevant information efficiently.
