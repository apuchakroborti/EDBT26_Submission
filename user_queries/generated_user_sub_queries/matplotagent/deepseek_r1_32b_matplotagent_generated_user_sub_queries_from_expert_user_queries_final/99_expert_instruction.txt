        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            To create a violin plot using Seaborn, you should use data from a h5 file named "99_h5_data.h5" 
which includes datasets `total_bill`, `tip`, `sex`, `smoker`, `day`, `time`, and `size`. 
The plot should focus on comparing the 'Total_Bill' amounts for different 'Day' values (days of the week), 
with a distinction between 'smoker' and 'non-smoker' categories. Implement split violins for this purpose, 
and within each violin, use quartiles to represent the data distribution. The color scheme should be green for smokers and grey for non-smokers. Adopt a dark style theme for the plot.

        ---
        Note: return only the the response of sub-queries only based on the below format, not explanation, not python code, and node additional text needed
        Return format:

Alright, I need to break down the user's query into three specific sub-queries as per the guidelines. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, the HDF5 Dataset Access sub-query should focus on accessing data from the specified H5 file using h5py. The datasets mentioned are 'total_bill', 'tip', 'sex', 'smoker', 'day', and 'size'. So I'll need to structure a query that asks how to read these specific datasets from "99_h5_data.h5" using h5py.

Next, the NumPy-based Data Preprocessing sub-query should handle any preprocessing steps. The user wants to split violins by 'smoker' categories and use quartiles within each violin. So I'll need to include how to process the data for these requirements, possibly involving masking or filtering with NumPy functions.

Lastly, the Plotting and Visualization sub-query is about creating a violin plot using Seaborn. The specifics are split violins by 'smoker', color scheme (green for smokers, grey for non-smokers), dark style, and quartiles. I'll need to frame this in terms of how to use Seaborn's violinplot function with these parameters.

I should ensure each sub-query is clear and targets the specific domain without overlapping information.

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
How to access datasets 'total_bill', 'tip', 'sex', 'smoker', 'day', and 'size' from an HDF5 file named "99_h5_data.h5" using h5py.

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
How to split data into 'smoker' and 'non-smoker' categories, compute quartiles for each category, and prepare the data for a violin plot using NumPy.

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
How to create a violin plot with split violins by 'Day', colored green for smokers and grey for non-smokers, using Seaborn with a dark style theme.
