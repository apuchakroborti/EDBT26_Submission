"""
        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            I want a polar coordinate diagram to visualize the highest temperature data in Amherst on the first of each month, spanning from January 1, 2004, to August 1, 2015. The data is named "95_h5_data.h5". 
The data contains three datasets: `Year`, `Date`, and `Temperature` 
Here are My specific requirements for the visualization:
- The diagram should be divided into 12 sectors, corresponding to the months of the year.
- Temperature data should be plotted on the diagram according to the month.
- The points representing the temperature data should be circular.
- These points should be slightly offset so as not to align on a single radial line, with each point for the 1st of a month positioned between that month and the next. The offset should range from 0 to π/6 radians.
- Month labels should be abbreviated (Jan, Feb, Mar, etc.) instead of numerical (1, 2, 3, etc.).
- A blue curve should connect the data points for the year 2015 to distinguish it from other years.
- The legend should be moved to the right to avoid overlapping the diagram.
The diagram will serve as a clear visual representation of temperature trends and variations by month over several years, with particular emphasis on the data from 2015.

Okay, so I need to break down this user query into three specific sub-queries. Let me read through the user's request carefully.

The user wants a polar coordinate diagram showing the highest temperature data in Amherst on the first of each month from 2004 to 2015. The data is stored in an HDF5 file named "95_h5_data.h5" and contains three datasets: Year, Date, and Temperature.

First, I'll tackle the HDF5 Dataset Access part. They need to access this specific file and extract the Year, Date, and Temperature datasets. So the sub-query should focus on how to use h5py to open the file and retrieve these datasets by their paths.

Next, for NumPy-based Data Preprocessing, they mentioned handling _FillValue, which I think refers to any missing or invalid data points. They also want masks applied using np.where or np.ma.masked_where. Additionally, preprocessing steps like filtering data for specific years (like 2015) and computing the highest temperatures per month are needed.

Lastly, the Plotting and Visualization part is quite detailed. They want a polar plot with 12 sectors for each month. The points should be circular and slightly offset between months. Month labels need to be abbreviated. A blue curve connects 2015 data, and the legend should be moved to the right.

So I'll structure each sub-query accordingly, making sure each focuses on its specific domain without overlapping.
