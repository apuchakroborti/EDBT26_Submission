"""
        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            I want to create a phase diagram of water using Python. The data is in a file called '84_h5_data.h5'.

- First, you should set up the chart with a horizontal axis for temperature and a vertical axis for pressure. These should be marked in Celsius, Kelvin, Pascals, bars and millibars, with conversions where necessary.
- Next, you should use the data to draw the lines that separate the solid, liquid, and gas phases of water. Use datasets Pressure(gas) and Pressure(liquid) of data to draw the line that separates the solid, liquid, and gas phases. Use datasets  temperature(K) and temperature(K).1 to draw the line that separates the solid and liquid phases.
- You should also mark two special points: the triple point at 273.16 K and 611.657 Pa, where solid, liquid, and gas coexist, and the critical point at 647.396 K and 22.064 MPa, where there's no difference between liquid and gas.
- You should draw two vertical red lines to show the freezing and boiling points of water at normal pressure.
- Make sure to label everything clearly, and color the different regions to show the solid, liquid, and gas phases.
- Finally, you should add a grid to make the chart easier to read, and ensure the pressure scale is logarithmic, since phase diagrams often cover a wide range of pressures.

 HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
```python
import h5py

# Open the file
with h5py.File('84_h5_data.h5', 'r') as f:
    # Accessing datasets or attributes
    print(f.attrs.keys())  # Access all attributes
    print(list(f.keys()))  # Access all datasets
    print(f['/Grid/cloudWater'])  # Access a specific dataset
```

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
```python
import numpy as np

# Assuming `_FillValue` is present in the data
data = np.ma.masked_where(data == data._FillValue, data)

# Applying min and max filters
filtered_data = np.minimum(np.maximum(data, min_value), max_value)

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create a new figure window
fig = plt.figure()

# Add a map to the figure
map = Basemap(projection='cyl', llcrnrlat=min_lat, urcrnrlat=max_lat, llcrnrlon=min_lon, urcrnrlon=max_lon)

# Draw coastlines and meridians/parallels
map.drawcoastlines()
map.drawmeridians(np.arange(min_lon, max_lon, 0.1))

# Add colorbar and title to the figure
cbar = map.colorbar()
plt.title('Phase Diagram of Water')

# Display the figure
plt.show()
