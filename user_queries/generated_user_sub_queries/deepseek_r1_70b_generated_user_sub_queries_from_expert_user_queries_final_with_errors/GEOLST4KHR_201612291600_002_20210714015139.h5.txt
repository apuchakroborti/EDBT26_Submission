        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            A Python script that reads an HDF5 file and generates a map visualization following these steps:

1. Import Libraries: Include necessary libraries such as `os`, `re`, `h5py`, `numpy` as `np`, `matplotlib` as `mpl`, `matplotlib.pyplot` as `plt`, and `mpl_toolkits.basemap.Basemap`.

2. Read HDF5 File: Open the HDF5 file in read-only mode.

3. Extract Data and Attributes:
   - Extract datasets including `/lst` (data of interest), `/lon` (longitude values), and `/lat` (latitude values).
   - Update data types for `/lst`, `/lon`, and `/lat` to `np.float64`.
   - Extract attributes: 'scale_factor', 'add_offset', 'units' (decode using `decode()`), '_FillValue', and 'long_name' (description, decode using `decode()`).

4. Preprocess Data:
   - Replace `_FillValue` in `/lst` data with `np.NaN`.
   - Apply scaling: `lst_data = scale_factor  lst_data + add_offset`.
   - Mask data using `numpy.masked_array` with `np.isnan` for `/lst`, `/lat`, and `/lon`.

5. Create Map Visualization:
   - Use an equidistant cylindrical projection with low resolution.
   - Set latitude bounds from -90 to 90 and longitude bounds from -180 to 180.
   - Add coastlines with a line width of 0.5.
   - Draw parallels at intervals of [-90, -60, -30, 0, 30, 60, 90, 120] and meridians at intervals of [-180, -135, -90, -45, 0, 45, 90, 135, 180].
   - Use `scatter` function with parameters: longitude, latitude, data, marker size 0.1, colormap `plt.cm.jet`, no edge colors, and linewidth 0.
   - Add a colorbar with label set to the decoded 'units' attribute.

Okay, so I need to break down this user's query into three specific sub-queries. Let me start by understanding what the user is asking for.

The user wants a Python script that reads an HDF5 file and creates a map visualization. They've outlined several steps: importing libraries, reading the HDF5 file, extracting data and attributes, preprocessing the data, and then creating the map.

First, I'll focus on the HDF5 part. The user mentioned using h5py to access datasets like /lst, /lon, /lat, and their attributes. So the sub-query should target accessing these specific paths and handling their metadata.

Next, for NumPy preprocessing, the user wants to replace _FillValue with NaNs, apply scaling, and mask data. I need to make sure the sub-query includes using np.where or masked arrays and applying min/max or other filters.

Lastly, the visualization part uses Basemap for an equidistant cylindrical projection. The sub-query should cover setting up the map with coastlines, meridians, parallels, using scatter plots, and adding a colorbar with specific units.

I'll structure each sub-query to be concise and focused on their respective domains so that relevant documentation can be easily retrieved.

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:  
How to use `h5py` to access HDF5 files, extract datasets such as `/lst`, `/lon`, `/lat`, and their attributes like 'scale_factor', 'add_offset', 'units', '_FillValue', and 'long_name'.

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:  
How to replace `_FillValue` with `np.NaN`, apply scaling using `scale_factor` and `add_offset`, and mask data using `numpy.masked_array` with `np.isnan`.

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:  
How to create an equidistant cylindrical projection map with low resolution, set latitude and longitude bounds, add coastlines, draw parallels and meridians at specific intervals, use `scatter` for visualization, and add a colorbar with the 'units' label.
