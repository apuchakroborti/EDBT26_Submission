        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            A Python script that processes an HDF5 file containing geospatial data. The script should follow these steps:

1. Import Necessary Libraries: Include libraries for OS operations (os), plotting (matplotlib and matplotlib.pyplot), 
numerical computations (numpy), map projections (mpl_toolkits.basemap), and handling HDF5 files.

2. Define Constants: Set a constant `FILE_NAME` to the path "ATL11_051911_0321_006_06.h5".

3. Open and Read HDF5 File: 
Open the file in read mode and access the datasets `latitude`, `longitude`, and `h_corr` from `pt1`. 
Extract attributes `units` and `long_name` using decoding with 'ascii' and 'replace', and retrieve `_FillValue` from the h_corr dataset.

4. Data Preprocessing:
   - Convert h_corr data to float.
   - Replace `_FillValue` with numpy NaN.
   - Mask data where values are NaN.

5. Create Map Projection: Use an equidistant cylindrical projection with low resolution, setting latitude from -90 to 90 and longitude from -180 to 180.

6. Customize Map:
   - Add coastlines with a line width of 0.5.
   - Draw parallels at intervals of 30 degrees starting from -90 till 120.
   - Draw meridians every 45 degrees from -180 to 180.

7. Generate Scatter Plot: Create a scatter plot using longitude and latitude coordinates, with data as the color variable. Use a marker size of 0.1, jet colormap, no edge colors, and no line widths.

8. Add Colorbar and Title:
   - Attach a colorbar below the map, labeled with the dataset's units.
   - Set the title to include the file basename, dataset path, and long_name from attributes.

Okay, so I need to break down this user's query into three specific sub-queries. Let me start by understanding what the user is asking for.

The user provided a Python script outline that processes an HDF5 file with geospatial data. They want the script to perform several steps: importing libraries, defining constants, opening and reading the HDF5 file, preprocessing data, creating a map projection, customizing the map, generating a scatter plot, and adding a colorbar and title.

My task is to split this into three focused sub-queries targeting specific technical domains. Each sub-query should be clear so that relevant documentation or examples can be retrieved using a vector database.

First, I'll look at each step in the user's script and categorize them under the three domains: HDF5 access, NumPy preprocessing, and map plotting/visualization.

1. **HDF5 Dataset Access**: This involves opening the file, accessing datasets like latitude, longitude, h_corr, and extracting attributes such as units and long_name. Also, retrieving _FillValue from h_corr.

2. **NumPy-based Data Preprocessing**: The steps here include converting data to float, replacing _FillValue with NaN, masking NaN values, and any other preprocessing logic like min or max calculations.

3. **Map Plotting and Visualization**: This covers setting up the map projection with specific parameters, adding coastlines, drawing parallels and meridians, creating a scatter plot with certain markers and colormaps, and adding colorbars and titles.

Now, I'll formulate each sub-query to be concise and focused on their respective domains without overlapping. Each should clearly state what's needed so that someone can find the right resources or code examples.
</think>

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:  
How do I open an HDF5 file using h5py and access datasets such as latitude, longitude, and h_corr from the pt1 group? Additionally, how can I extract attributes like units and long_name with specific decoding options and retrieve the _FillValue attribute?

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:  
What methods are available in NumPy to convert data to float, replace a specified fill value with NaN, and apply masks to handle NaN values effectively?

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:  
Using matplotlib or cartopy, how can I create an equidistant cylindrical projection map, add coastlines, draw parallels and meridians at specific intervals, generate a scatter plot with longitude and latitude coordinates, and customize the visualization with colorbars and titles?
