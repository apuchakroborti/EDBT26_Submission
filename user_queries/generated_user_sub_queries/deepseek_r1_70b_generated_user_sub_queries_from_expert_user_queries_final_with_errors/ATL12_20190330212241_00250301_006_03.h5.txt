"""
        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            Step-by-Step Code Requirements
1. Import Necessary Libraries
   - Import libraries for OS functions (os), plotting (matplotlib, matplotlib.pyplot), numerical operations (numpy), map projections (mpl_toolkits.basemap).

2. Define Constants
   - Set `FILE_NAME` to "ATL12_20190330212241_00250301_006_03.h5".

3. Open HDF5 File and Access Datasets
   - Open the file in read mode.
   - Extract datasets: `latitude`, `longitude`, and `swh` data from /gt1l/ssh_segments

4. Read Dataset Attributes
   - Retrieve 'units' and 'long_name' attributes from the swh dataset, decoding them with ASCII and replacing errors.
   - Extract the '_FillValue' attribute from the swh dataset.

5. Data Processing and Cleaning
   - Convert data to float type.
   - Replace _FillValue with numpy NaN.
   - Mask data where values are NaN using numpy's masked_where.

6. Create Map Projection
   - Use an equidistant cylindrical projection.
   - Set resolution to 'low'.
   - Define latitude and longitude bounds from -90 to 90 and -180 to 180, respectively.

7. Customize Map Features
   - Add coastlines with a line width of 0.5.
   - Draw parallels at latitudes [-90, 120, 30] using numpy.arange.
   - Draw meridians at longitudes [-180, 180, 45] using numpy.arange.

8. Plot Data on Map
   - Use scatter plot with longitude and latitude coordinates.
   - Set marker size (s=0.1), colormap (jet), remove edge colors, and set linewidth to 0.

9. Add Colorbar and Title
   - Attach a colorbar below the map, labeled with dataset units.
   - Set the title to include the filename, dataset path, and long_name attribute.

Okay, so I need to break down this user query into three specific sub-queries. Let me read through the user's requirements carefully.

First, they want HDF5 Dataset Access using h5py. They mentioned accessing files with certain extensions, extracting datasets like latitude and longitude from specific paths, and handling metadata such as attributes. So my first sub-query should focus on these aspects.

Next is NumPy-based Data Preprocessing. The user wants to handle _FillValue, apply masks with np.where or np.ma.masked_where, convert data types, replace fill values with NaNs, and use min/max for filtering. I need to make sure this sub-query covers all these preprocessing steps.

Lastly, Map Plotting and Visualization using matplotlib, basemap, or cartopy. They specified setting up an equidistant cylindrical projection, adding coastlines, drawing parallels and meridians at specific intervals, and customizing the map with a colorbar and title. I should structure this sub-query to address each of these visualization elements.

I need to ensure each sub-query is concise and targets only the relevant technical domains so that the user can retrieve the necessary documentation or examples from a vector database.

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:  
How do I use `h5py` to open an HDF5 file named "ATL12_20190330212241_00250301_006_03.h5" in read mode and access the datasets `latitude`, `longitude`, and `swh` from the `/gt1l/ssh_segments` group? Additionally, how do I retrieve the 'units' and 'long_name' attributes of the `swh` dataset and decode them using ASCII with error handling?

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:  
What is the correct way to convert the `swh` data to float type, replace the `_FillValue` with `numpy NaN`, and mask the data where values are NaN using `np.ma.masked_where`? Should I use `np.where` or other NumPy functions for filtering based on min/max values?

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:  
How can I create an equidistant cylindrical projection map using `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, set the resolution to 'low', and define latitude bounds from -90 to 90 and longitude bounds from -180 to 180? What steps are needed to add coastlines with a line width of 0.5, draw parallels at specific latitudes using `numpy.arange`, and meridians at specific longitudes using `numpy.arange`?
