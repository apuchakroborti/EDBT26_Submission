"""
        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            File Input and Constants
- Specify the input file as `MOP02J-20131129-L2V19.9.3.he5` stored in the constant `FILE_NAME`.
- Import necessary libraries: `os`, `datetime`, `h5py`, `numpy` as `np`, `matplotlib` as `mpl`, `matplotlib.pyplot` as `plt`, and `mpl_toolkits.basemap.Basemap`.

Extracting Data
- Extract data from the HDF5 dataset at `RetrievedSurfaceTemperature` from the group `/HDFEOS/SWATHS/MOP02/Data Fields`.
- Read the first column of this dataset into an array named `data`.
- Retrieve the `units` and `_FillValue` attributes associated with the RetrievedSurfaceTemperaturehis dataset.
- Decode the `units` string using the `decode()` function.

Data Preprocessing and Cleaning
- Replace values in `data` that match `_FillValue` with `numpy.nan`.

Extracting Geolocation Data
- Extract latitude data from `Latitude`, longitude data from `Longitude` from the group `/HDFEOS/SWATHS/MOP02/Geolocation Fields`

Creating a Map
- Add coastlines with a line width of 0.5.
- Draw parallels using `numpy.arange(-90, 91, 45)`.
- Draw meridians using `numpy.arange(-180, 180, 45)` and set labels to `[True, False, False, True]`.

Scatter Plot Configuration
- Use the `scatter` function with parameters: longitude, latitude, `c=data`, marker size `s=1`, colormap `plt.cm.jet`, no edge colors (`edgecolors=None`), and line width `linewidth=0`.

Customizing the Map
- Add a colorbar to represent data units.
- Set the colorbar label using the decoded `units` value.

Okay, so I need to break down this user query into three specific sub-queries. Let me start by reading through the entire query carefully.

The user is working with an HDF5 file, specifically MOP02J-20131129-L2V19.9.3.he5. They want to extract data from a dataset called RetrievedSurfaceTemperature located in /HDFEOS/SWATHS/MOP02/Data Fields. They also need the units and _FillValue attributes. Then, they'll read the first column into an array named data.

Next, for preprocessing, they want to replace values matching _FillValue with numpy.nan. That makes sense because _FillValue is a common placeholder for missing data in HDF5 files.

For geolocation, they need latitude and longitude from /HDFEOS/SWATHS/MOP02/Geolocation Fields. So I'll include extracting those datasets.

Now, the visualization part involves using Basemap to create a map with coastlines, specific parallels and meridians, and a scatter plot of the data. They also want a colorbar labeled with the decoded units.

I need to split this into three sub-queries: HDF5 access, NumPy preprocessing, and plotting with Basemap.

For HDF5, focus on accessing the file, reading datasets, and retrieving attributes. Mention h5py methods like get() for datasets and attrs.items() for attributes.

In NumPy, it's about handling _FillValue and masking. Use np.where or masked_where to replace fill values with NaNs.

Plotting should cover setting up Basemap, drawing features, creating the scatter plot, adding colorbar, and labels. Include parameters like projection, resolution, coastlines, etc.

I think that covers all parts without overlapping. Each sub-query is specific to its domain.

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:  
How do I access the HDF5 dataset `RetrievedSurfaceTemperature` from the group `/HDFEOS/SWATHS/MOP02/Data Fields` using `h5py`, and retrieve its associated attributes `units` and `_FillValue`?  

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:  
How can I replace values in a NumPy array that match `_FillValue` with `numpy.nan` to handle missing data effectively?  

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:  
How do I create a scatter plot using `matplotlib` and `mpl_toolkits.basemap.Basemap` to visualize geospatial data, including adding coastlines, drawing parallels and meridians, and customizing the colorbar with labels?
