        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            1. Import Necessary Libraries: Include libraries for OS functions (os), plotting (matplotlib, matplotlib.pyplot), numerical operations (numpy), map projections (mpl_toolkits.basemap), and HDF5 handling.

2. Define Constants: Set `FILE_NAME` to "ATL20-01_20181101001332_05100101_004_01.h5".

3. Open HDF5 File: Access the file in read mode and extract datasets `/grid_lat`, `/grid_lon`, and `/monthly/mean_fb`.

4. Extract Attributes: From the mean_fb dataset, decode 'units' and 'long_name' using ASCII with replace errors, and retrieve '_FillValue'.

5. Data Processing:
   - Convert mean_fb data to float.
   - Replace _FillValue with NaN.
   - Mask data where values are NaN.

6. Create Map Projection: Use npstere with low resolution, boundinglat=60, lon_0=45.

7. Customize Map:
   - Add coastlines (linewidth=0.5).
   - Draw parallels at [-90, 120, 30] to be more specific from -90 to 120 with interval of 30.
   - Draw meridians at [-180, 180, 45] to be be more specific from -180 to 180 with interval of 45.

8. Adjust Longitude: 
   Before setting pcolormesh the 180 should be subtractted from longitude value and update the longitude existing value 
   Then it adds pcolormesh with parameters longitude, latitude, data, and latlon=True

9. Add Colorbar and Title:
    - Position colorbar at the bottom, labeled with dataset units.
    - Set title using file basename and 'long_name' attribute.

Okay, so I need to break down this user query into three focused sub-queries. Let me read through the original query first.

The user has a series of steps they want to perform, starting from importing libraries all the way to visualizing data on a map. My task is to split these steps into three specific areas: HDF5 access, NumPy preprocessing, and plotting with visualization tools.

First, looking at step 1, it's about importing libraries like os, matplotlib, numpy, basemap, and h5py. But since the sub-queries are focused on technical domains, I don't need to include this in any of them. It's more of a setup step.

Step 2 defines constants, specifically the file name. Again, this is setup and not part of the sub-queries.

Step 3 involves opening an HDF5 file and extracting specific datasets. This clearly falls under HDF5 Dataset Access. So I'll note that as the first sub-query, focusing on accessing those paths using h5py.

Step 4 is about extracting attributes from a dataset, decoding strings, and getting the _FillValue. That's still within HDF5 access since it's dealing with metadata extraction.

Moving to step 5, this involves data processing: converting data types, replacing fill values with NaNs, and masking. This is NumPy-based preprocessing, so I'll create a sub-query around handling _FillValue and masking using numpy functions.

Step 6 through 9 are about creating a map projection, customizing it with coastlines, meridians, parallels, adjusting longitude, adding pcolormesh, colorbar, and title. These all fall under plotting and visualization using tools like matplotlib or cartopy. So the third sub-query will cover these aspects.

I need to make sure each sub-query is concise and only includes relevant parts from the user's steps without mixing domains. Also, I should avoid any additional explanations or code, just the focused sub-queries as per the instructions.

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:  
Access HDF5 file "ATL20-01_20181101001332_05100101_004_01.h5" in read mode using `h5py`, extract datasets `/grid_lat`, `/grid_lon`, and `/monthly/mean_fb`. Extract attributes 'units' and 'long_name' from the mean_fb dataset, decode them using ASCII with replace errors, and retrieve '_FillValue'.

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:  
Convert mean_fb data to float, replace _FillValue with NaN using `np.where` or `np.ma.masked_where`, and mask data where values are NaN.

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:  
Create a map projection using npstere with low resolution, boundinglat=60, lon_0=45. Customize the map by adding coastlines (linewidth=0.5), drawing parallels at [-90, 120, 30], and meridians at [-180, 180, 45]. Adjust longitude values by subtracting 180 before plotting with pcolormesh. Add a colorbar positioned at the bottom labeled with dataset units and set the title using the file basename and 'long_name' attribute.
