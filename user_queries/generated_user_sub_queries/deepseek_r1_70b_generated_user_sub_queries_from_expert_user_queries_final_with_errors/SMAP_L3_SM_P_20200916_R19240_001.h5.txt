        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            A Python script that performs the following tasks:

1. Import Libraries: Import os, matplotlib.pyplot as plt, numpy as np, and mpl_toolkits.basemap.Basemap.

2. Read Data from HDF5 File:
   - Open an HDF5 file.
   - Read datasets: soil_moisture from `soil_moisture`, 
      latitude from `latitude`, and longitude from `longitude` from the group `Soil_Moisture_Rettrieval_Data_AM`.
   - Retrieve attributes: units, long_name, _FillValue, valid_max, and valid_min from the soil_moisture dataset.

3. Decode Units and Long Name: Decode byte strings using decode('ascii', 'replace') for units and long_name.

4. Calculate Invalid Data:
   - Use numpy.logical_or to find data where soil_moisture is outside valid_min and valid_max.
   - Update invalid data where it equals _FillValue.
   - Replace invalid points with NaNs.

5. Create Masked Array: Use numpy.masked_where with isnan(soil_moisture) to mask the data.

6. Create Map and Visualize Data:
   - Set up an equidistant cylindrical projection map using Basemap with low resolution.
   - Draw coastlines with line width 0.5, parallels at [-180, -135, -90, -45, 0, 45, 90], and meridians at [-180, -135, -90, -45, 0, 45, 90, 135, 180].
   - Create a scatter plot of soil_moisture data using longitude and latitude coordinates, with markers size 1, colormap jet, no edge color, and linewidth 0.
   - Add a colorbar labeled with the decoded units.
   - Set the title as the HDF5 file's basename concatenated with the long_name attribute.

Okay, so I need to break down this user's query into three specific sub-queries. Let me start by understanding what each part of their task entails.

First, the user wants a Python script that does several things: import libraries, read HDF5 data, preprocess it with NumPy, and then visualize using Basemap. My job is to split this into three focused areas: HDF5 access, NumPy preprocessing, and map plotting.

Looking at the first part, they're using h5py to open an HDF5 file and access specific datasets and attributes. So I need to frame a sub-query that targets just that—opening the file, reading the datasets from the correct group, and retrieving the necessary attributes like units and _FillValue.

Next, for NumPy preprocessing, the user is handling invalid data by checking against valid ranges and using logical_or. They also replace invalid points with NaNs and create a masked array. My sub-query here should focus on these steps: identifying invalid data, updating it, masking, etc., using functions like np.where or np.ma.masked_where.

Lastly, the visualization part uses Basemap to set up a map projection, draw coastlines and grid lines, plot the data as a scatter plot, add a colorbar, and set the title. I need to make sure this sub-query covers all these aspects without mixing in other parts of the task.

I should ensure each sub-query is concise and targets only its specific domain so that relevant resources can be easily found using a vector database.
