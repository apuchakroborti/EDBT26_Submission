        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            A Python script that reads and visualizes data from an HDF5 file with the following steps:

1. Import Libraries: Include os, h5py, matplotlib, matplotlib.pyplot, mpl_toolkits.basemap, and numpy.

2. Read HDF5 File: Open the file located at "DeepBlue-SeaWiFS_L2_20101210T135954Z_v004-20130525T172725Z.h5".

3. Access Dataset: Extract the dataset named `aerosol_optical_thickness_550_ocean`.

4. Extract Metadata: Retrieve the long_name and units from the aerosol_optical_thickness_550_ocean dataset, decoding them using decode().

5. Preprocess Data:
   - Replace -999 values with NaN.
   - Create a masked array using numpy's masked_array function, masking where data is NaN.

6. Set Up Visualization:
   - Use an orthographic map projection with mean latitude and longitude.
   - Add coastlines with 0.5 width.
   - Draw parallels at -90° to 120 with interval 30°; meridians at -180° to 180°, and 45° intervals.

7. Create Pseudocolor Plot: Use matplotlib's pcmesh with latlon=True, plotting longitude, latitude, and aerosol data.

8. Customize Plot:
   - Add a colorbar labeled with the dataset's units.
   - Set the title using the filename and long_name of the dataset.

Okay, so I need to break down this user's query into three specific sub-queries. Let me start by understanding what the user is asking for.

The user provided a Python script outline that involves reading an HDF5 file and visualizing its data. They want me to split this task into three focused areas: accessing the HDF5 dataset, preprocessing the data with NumPy, and plotting it using mapping tools.

First, I'll look at the HDF5 part. The user is using h5py to open a specific file and access a dataset named 'aerosol_optical_thickness_550_ocean'. They also need to extract metadata like long_name and units. So, the sub-query should focus on how to use h5py for these actions.

Next, the preprocessing step involves replacing -999 with NaNs and creating a masked array. The user mentioned using NumPy functions like np.where or np.ma.masked_where. I'll need to frame this as a query about handling fill values and masking in NumPy.

Lastly, the visualization part uses matplotlib and basemap for an orthographic projection, adding coastlines, meridians, parallels, and creating a pseudocolor plot with a colorbar and title. The sub-query should target how to set up these elements using the specified libraries.

I need to ensure each sub-query is concise and directly addresses one technical domain so that relevant resources can be found easily.

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:  
How to use `h5py` to open an HDF5 file named "DeepBlue-SeaWiFS_L2_20101210T135954Z_v004-20130525T172725Z.h5" and access the dataset `/aerosol_optical_thickness_550_ocean`, including retrieving its `long_name` and `units` attributes.

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:  
How to replace `-999` values with NaN in a NumPy array and create a masked array using `numpy.ma.masked_where` or similar functions for handling missing data.

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:  
How to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to create an orthographic map projection, add coastlines with 0.5 width, draw parallels from -90° to 120° at 30° intervals and meridians from -180° to 180° at 45° intervals, and generate a pseudocolor plot using `pcmesh` with latlon=True for geospatial data visualization.
