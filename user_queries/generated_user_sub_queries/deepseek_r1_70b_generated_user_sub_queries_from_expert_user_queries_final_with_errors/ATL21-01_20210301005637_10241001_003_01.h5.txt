        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            1. Import Necessary Libraries:  
   - Import `os` for operating system functions.  
   - Import `matplotlib` and `matplotlib.pyplot` for plotting and visualizations.  
   - Import `numpy` for numerical computations.  
   - Import `mpl_toolkits.basemap` for map projections.

2. Define Constants:  
   - Define a constant `FILE_NAME` with the value `'ATL21-01_20210301005637_10241001_003_01.h5'`.

3. Open HDF5 File and Access Datasets:  
   - Open the HDF5 file in read mode (`'r'`).  
   - Access three datasets:  
     - `/grid_lat` for latitude data.  
     - `/grid_lon` for longitude data.  
     - `/monthly/mean_weighted_mss` as the main dataset.  

4. Read Dataset Attributes:  
   - Read `units`, `long_name`, and `_FillValue` attributes from the mean_weighted_mss dataset.  
   - Decode text attributes using `decode('ascii', 'replace')`.  

5. Process Main Data:  
   - Convert the main data to a float type using `.astype(float)`.  
   - Replace the `_FillValue` with `numpy.NaN`.  
   - Mask the data using `numpy.ma.masked_where(numpy.isnan(data), data)`.

6. Create Map Visualization:  
   - Use an NPSTERE (North Polar Stereographic) projection map.  
   - Set map resolution to low and bounding latitude to 60 degrees, with longitude center (`lon_0`) at 45 degrees.  

7. Customize Map Features:  
   - Add coastlines with a line width of 0.5.  
   - Draw parallels at latitudes [-90, 120, 30] such as from -90 to 120 with interval 30.  
   - Draw meridians at longitudes [-180, 180, 45] such as from -180 to 180 with interval 45.  

8. Plot Data on the Map:  
   - Use `pcolormesh` to plot the data with parameters: longitude, latitude, and data.  
   - Ensure `latlon=True` for geographic coordinates.

9. Add Colorbar and Title:  
   - Add a colorbar to the map, positioned at the bottom.  
   - Label the colorbar with the main dataset's `units`.  
   - Set the title of the visualization to include the file basename and the `long_name` attribute from the main dataset.

Okay, so I'm trying to break down this user's query into three focused sub-queries. Let me start by reading through their entire request carefully.

The user has a detailed 9-step process involving HDF5 files, data preprocessing with NumPy, and map visualization using matplotlib and basemap. My task is to split this into three specific areas: HDF5 access, NumPy preprocessing, and plotting with visualization tools.

First, looking at the HDF5 part. The user wants to open an HDF5 file, access specific datasets like /grid_lat and /monthly/mean_weighted_mss, and read their attributes such as units and _FillValue. So I need to frame a sub-query that captures these actions using h5py.

Next, for NumPy preprocessing, the steps involve converting data to float, replacing fill values with NaNs, and masking using np.where or np.ma.masked_where. The sub-query should focus on handling these operations specifically with NumPy functions.

Lastly, the visualization part uses basemap to create a map with specific projections, coastlines, meridians, parallels, and then plotting the data with pcolormesh. I need to ensure the sub-query includes setting up the projection correctly, adding geographical features, and plotting the data with appropriate parameters like latlon=True.

I should make sure each sub-query is concise and only covers its respective domain without overlapping into others. That way, when someone looks them up in a vector database, they can find relevant examples or documentation easily.

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:  
How to open an HDF5 file using `h5py` and access datasets at paths `/grid_lat`, `/grid_lon`, and `/monthly/mean_weighted_mss`. Also, how to read attributes like `units`, `long_name`, and `_FillValue` from the dataset.

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:  
How to convert data to float type using `.astype(float)`, replace `_FillValue` with `numpy.NaN`, and mask data using `numpy.ma.masked_where(numpy.isnan(data), data)`.

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:  
How to create an NPSTERE (North Polar Stereographic) projection map with low resolution, bounding latitude at 60 degrees, and longitude center (`lon_0`) at 45 degrees. Also, how to add coastlines, draw parallels at latitudes [-90, 120, 30], meridians at longitudes [-180, 180, 45], plot data using `pcolormesh` with `latlon=True`, and customize the visualization with a colorbar and title.
