        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            A Python script that processes and visualizes data from an HDF-EOS5 file by following these steps:

1. Import necessary libraries: os, pyproj, re, matplotlib.pyplot as plt, mpl_toolkits.basemap.Basemap, numpy as np.

2. Define constants for the main dataset path ('/HDFEOS/GRIDS/NpPolarGrid25km/Data Fields/SI_25km_NH_89V_DAY') 
and grid metadata path ('/HDFEOS INFORMATION/StructMetadata.0').

3. Create a function that takes a file name as input, opens the HDF-EOS5 file, extracts metadata, and retrieves projection parameters.

4. Convert the main dataset to numpy.float64 using astype.

5. Preprocess the data by:
   - Setting values equal to 0 to NaN.
   - Scaling the data by multiplying with 0.1.
   - Creating a masked array using numpy.ma.masked_array where data is invalid.

6. Construct the grid using extracted projection parameters and data shape, then transform coordinates from EASE Grid to WGS84 using pyproj.

7. Create a map using Basemap with:
   - npstere projection.
   - Low resolution.
   - boundinglat=33 and lon_0=0.
   - Coastlines with linewidth 0.5.
   - Parallels at latitudes [0, 90, 20] with labels [1, 0, 0, 0].
   - Meridians at longitudes [-180, 181, 45] with labels [0, 0, 0, 1].

8. Add a pcolormesh layer using longitude, latitude, and data with latlon=True.

9. Include a colorbar labeled with the main dataset's units.

10. Set the plot title to include the file basename and the main dataset's long_name containing 'SI_25km_NH_89V_DAY'.

Okay, so I need to break down this user query into three specific sub-queries. Let me read through the user's task carefully.

The user wants a Python script that processes and visualizes data from an HDF-EOS5 file. The steps include importing libraries, defining paths, creating functions for accessing metadata, converting datasets, preprocessing data, constructing grids, transforming coordinates, setting up a map with Basemap, adding layers, colorbars, and titles.

First, I'll tackle the HDF5 Dataset Access part. The user is using h5py to access an HDF-EOS5 file. They need to open the file, extract metadata from specific paths like '/HDFEOS/GRIDS/NpPolarGrid25km/Data Fields/SI_25km_NH_89V_DAY' and '/HDFEOS INFORMATION/StructMetadata.0'. So the sub-query should focus on how to use h5py for accessing these datasets, their attributes, and metadata.

Next is NumPy-based Data Preprocessing. The steps involve converting data to float64, setting zeros to NaNs, scaling by 0.1, and creating a masked array where data is invalid. So the sub-query should cover handling _FillValue, using np.where or masked_where, and preprocessing techniques like min, max, etc.

Lastly, for Map Plotting and Visualization, the user uses matplotlib, Basemap, and pyproj. They need to set up a map with specific projections (npstere), add coastlines, parallels, meridians, use pcolormesh, colorbars, and titles. The sub-query should focus on these visualization aspects using the mentioned libraries.

I'll make sure each sub-query is clear and targets only its respective domain without overlapping.

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
How to access an HDF-EOS5 file using h5py, extract metadata from '/HDFEOS INFORMATION/StructMetadata.0', retrieve projection parameters, and read the main dataset located at '/HDFEOS/GRIDS/NpPolarGrid25km/Data Fields/SI_25km_NH_89V_DAY'?

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
How to preprocess data by converting an HDF5 dataset to numpy.float64, setting values equal to 0 to NaN, scaling the data by multiplying with 0.1, and creating a masked array using numpy.ma.masked_array where data is invalid?

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
How to create a map plot using matplotlib and Basemap with npstere projection, add coastlines, parallels at [0,90,20] with labels [1,0,0,0], meridians at [-180,181,45] with labels [0,0,0,1], use pcolormesh to plot data with latlon=True, add a colorbar labeled with the dataset's units, and set the title to include the file basename and dataset's long_name?
