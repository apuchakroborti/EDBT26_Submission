        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            1. Import Libraries: Include necessary modules for OS operations, plotting, numerical computations, map projections, and HDF5 handling.

2. Define Constants: Set `FILE_NAME` to "ATL06_20190223232535_08780212_006_02.h5".

3. Read HDF5 Data: Open the file in read mode and extract datasets for 
    `/gt1l/land_ice_segments/latitude` latitude data, 
    `/gt1l/land_ice_segments/longitude` longitude data, 
and `/gt1l/land_ice_segments/h_li` main data  
Retrieve attributes using decode() and handle _FillValue.

4. Preprocess Data: Replace _FillValue in h_li with NaNs and mask invalid data using numpy functions.

5. Create Map: Using an equidistant cylindrical projection map 
with low resolution and latitude and longitude values from -90 to 90 and -180 to 180 respectively. 
It also adds coastlines with linewidth of 0.5, 
parallels with parameters of nummpy arrange with values -90, 120, 30, 
and meridians with parameters numpy arrange -180, 180, 45

6. Plot Data: 
The program should set scatter function with parameters of longitude, latitude, c=data, s=0.1, cmap=plt.cm.jet, edgecolors=None, and linewidth=0
Generate a scatter plot of the data with given parameters including colormap and marker size.

7. Add Colorbar and Title: Include a colorbar labeled with dataset units and set the title using the file's basename and long_name.

Okay, so I need to break down the user's query into three specific sub-queries. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, looking at the user's task, they want to import libraries, define constants, read HDF5 data, preprocess it, create a map, plot data, and add colorbar/title. But I need to split this into three focused areas: HDF5 access, NumPy preprocessing, and plotting visualization.

For the HDF5 part, the key points are accessing specific datasets like latitude, longitude, and h_li from an HDF5 file using h5py. Also, handling attributes with decode() and dealing with _FillValue. So I'll make a sub-query that captures all these aspects without mentioning other steps.

Next, the preprocessing involves replacing _FillValue with NaNs and masking data using NumPy functions like np.where or masked_where. The user also mentions applying min/max or other logic, so I should include that in the sub-query to cover any necessary filtering or computations.

Lastly, for plotting, they want a map using matplotlib or cartopy with specific projections, coastlines, meridians, parallels, and colorbars. The scatter plot parameters are important here too, like marker size and colormap. So the sub-query should focus on setting up the map correctly and adding all these elements as specified.

I need to ensure each sub-query is clear and only targets its respective domain without overlapping with others. That way, when someone uses a vector database, they can find relevant info for each part easily.
