        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            A Python script that performs the following tasks:

1. Import Libraries: Import the required libraries, including `os`, `datetime`, `h5py`, `numpy` as `np`, `matplotlib` as `mpl`, `matplotlib.pyplot` as `plt`, and `Basemap` from `mpl_toolkits.basemap`.

2. Read HDF-EOS File: Open and read the HDF-EOS file named `MOP03TM-201802-L3V95.9.1.he5`.

3. Access Datasets:
   - Read the dataset located at `/HDFEOS/GRIDS/MOP03/Data Fields/RetrievedSurfaceTemperatureDay` into a variable named `data`.
   - Extract attributes from this dataset, including `long_name`, `units`, and `_FillValue`. Decode string attributes using the `decode()` method.

4. Data Preprocessing:
   - Replace values in the `RetrievedSurfaceTemperatureDay` dataset that match `_FillValue` with `NaN`.
   - Create a masked array using `numpy.ma.masked_array` to mask invalid or missing data points identified by `numpy.isnan`.

5. Retrieve Geolocation Information:
   - Extract latitude and longitude datasets from `/HDFEOS/GRIDS/MOP03/Data Fields/Latitude` and `/HDFEOS/GRIDS/MOP03/Data Fields/Longitude`, respectively, into variables named `x` (latitude) and `y` (longitude).
   - Generate a 2D meshgrid using `numpy.meshgrid` from the latitude and longitude data.

6. Create Basemap:
   - Set up a cylindrical projection map with low resolution.
   - Define the map boundaries with latitude ranging from -90 to 90 and longitude from -180 to 180.
   - Add coastlines with a line width of 0.5.
   - Draw parallels using `numpy.arange` with values at -90, 91, 45(start, stop, interval) and meridians with values at -180, -135, -90, -45, 0, 45, 90, 135, 180. 
      Set labels for these meridians as `[True, False, False, True]`.
   - Use `pcolormesh` to plot the data on the map, ensuring `latlon=True`.

7. Visualize Data:
   - Add a colorbar to the plot.
   - Label the colorbar using the `units` attribute from the dataset.

Alright, I need to break down the user's query into three specific sub-queries as per their instructions. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, looking at the HDF5 Dataset Access section. The user is working with an HDF-EOS file and needs to access several datasets and attributes. They mentioned opening the file `MOP03TM-201802-L3V95.9.1.he5` using h5py, reading specific datasets like `/HDFEOS/GRIDS/MOP03/Data Fields/RetrievedSurfaceTemperatureDay`, extracting attributes such as `long_name`, `units`, and `_FillValue`, and decoding string attributes. So the sub-query should focus on these aspects without mentioning other libraries or steps.

Next, for NumPy-based Data Preprocessing, the user wants to replace _FillValue with NaNs and create a masked array using numpy.ma.masked_array. They also mentioned using np.isnan for masking. The sub-query needs to capture this preprocessing logic clearly, ensuring it's focused solely on these operations without including file access or plotting details.

Lastly, the Map Plotting and Visualization section involves setting up a Basemap with specific projections, boundaries, coastlines, parallels, meridians, and labels. They also want to use pcolormesh for plotting and add a colorbar labeled with the dataset's units. The sub-query should detail these visualization steps using matplotlib and basemap without delving into data preprocessing or file access.

I need to make sure each sub-query is concise and only includes the relevant parts as specified, avoiding any overlap between them. Also, I must present them in the exact format requested: three separate lines with each sub-query clearly labeled.
