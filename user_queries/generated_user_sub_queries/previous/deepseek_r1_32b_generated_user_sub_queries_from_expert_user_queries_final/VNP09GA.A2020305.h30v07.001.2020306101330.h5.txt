        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            A Python script that reads an HDF5 file and generates a map plot with the following specifications:

1. Import Libraries:  
   - Import necessary libraries: `os`, `re`, `h5py`, `numpy` (as `np`), `matplotlib` (as `mpl`), and `matplotlib.pyplot` (as `plt`) for file operations, metadata parsing, HDF5 handling, numerical computations, and visualization.

2. Read HDF5 File:  
   - Access the dataset `/HDFEOS/GRIDS/VNP_Grid_500m_2D/Data Fields/SurfReflect_I3_1`.  
   - Read the data into a NumPy array and convert it to `np.float64` using `astype(np.float)`.

3. Extract Attributes:  
   - Extract attributes (`Scale`, `Offset`, `units`, `_FillValue`, `long_name`) from the `SurfReflect_I3_1` dataset. Use the `decode()` function for `units` and `long_name`.  

4. Grid Metadata:  
   - Read the `/HDFEOS INFORMATION/StructMetadata.0` dataset.  
   - Extract `upper_left_x` and `upper_left_y` using a regex pattern:  
     ```
     UpperLeftPointMtrs=\((?P<upper_left_x>[+-]?\d+\.\d+),(?P<upper_left_y>[+-]?\d+\.\d+)\)
     ```  
   - Use this data to construct meshgrid coordinates for longitude and latitude.

5. Coordinate Transformation:  
   - Perform a coordinate transformation from Sinusoidal to WGS84 (Latitude-Longitude) using a projection library.

6. Data Processing:  
   - Apply the `_FillValue` to the `SurfReflect_I3_1` dataset, setting NaN values where necessary.  
   - Scale and offset the data:  
     ```
     SurfReflect_I3_1 = scale  SurfReflect_I3_1 + offset
     ```

7. Visualization:  
   - Create a map using a cylindrical projection with low resolution.  
   - Set the latitude range from `min(latitude)` to `max(latitude)` and longitude range from `min(longitude)` to `max(longitude)`.  
   - Add parallels (latitude gridlines):  
     ```
     np.arange(floor(min_latitude), ceil(max_latitude), 1)
     ```  
     with labels at `[1, 0, 0, 0]` (top only).  

   - Add meridians (longitude gridlines):  
     ```
     np.arange(floor(min_longitude), ceil(max_longitude), 2)
     ```  
     with labels at `[0, 0, 0, 1]` (right only).  

   - Use `pcolormesh` to plot the data:  
     ```
     plt.pcolormesh(longitude, latitude, SurfReflect_I3_1, latlon=True)
     ```

   - Add a colorbar with the label set to the `units` attribute.  
   - Set the plot title as the concatenation of the base name of the HDF5 file and the `long_name` attribute.

This structured query provides clear instructions for generating the desired Python script.

Alright, I need to break down the user's query into three specific sub-queries as per their instructions. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, looking at the HDF5 Dataset Access section. The user wants to access a specific dataset within an HDF5 file using h5py. They mention accessing `/HDFEOS/GRIDS/VNP_Grid_500m_2D/Data Fields/SurfReflect_I3_1` and extracting certain attributes like Scale, Offset, _FillValue, etc. So the sub-query should focus on how to use h5py to open the file, access that dataset path, read it into a NumPy array, and extract those specific attributes.

Next, for the NumPy-based Data Preprocessing part. The user needs to handle the _FillValue by replacing it with NaNs, then scale and offset the data. They also mention using functions like np.where or masked arrays. So the sub-query should cover how to apply these preprocessing steps using NumPy operations.

Lastly, the Map Plotting and Visualization section involves creating a map plot using matplotlib, specifically with basemap or cartopy for projections. The user wants a cylindrical projection, adding parallels and meridians with specific labels, using pcolormesh for plotting, adding a colorbar, and setting the title correctly. So the sub-query should focus on how to set up the map, add gridlines, plot the data, and customize the visualization elements.

I need to make sure each sub-query is clear and targets only its respective domain without overlapping with others. Also, I must avoid any explanations or code examples, just the focused questions.
