        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            A Python script that reads and visualizes data from an HDF5 file with the following steps:

1. Import Libraries: Include os, h5py, matplotlib, matplotlib.pyplot, mpl_toolkits.basemap, and numpy.

2. Read HDF5 File: Open the file located at "DeepBlue-SeaWiFS_L2_20101210T135954Z_v004-20130525T172725Z.h5".

3. Access Dataset: Extract the dataset named `aerosol_optical_thickness_550_ocean`.

4. Extract Metadata: Retrieve the long_name and units from the aerosol_optical_thickness_550_ocean dataset, decoding them using decode().

5. Preprocess Data:
   - Replace -999 values with NaN.
   - Create a masked array using numpy's masked_array function, masking where data is NaN.

6. Set Up Visualization:
   - Use an orthographic map projection with mean latitude and longitude.
   - Add coastlines with 0.5 width.
   - Draw parallels at -90° to 120 with interval 30°; meridians at -180° to 180°, and 45° intervals.

7. Create Pseudocolor Plot: Use matplotlib's pcmesh with latlon=True, plotting longitude, latitude, and aerosol data.

8. Customize Plot:
   - Add a colorbar labeled with the dataset's units.
   - Set the title using the filename and long_name of the dataset.

Alright, I need to break down the user's query into three specific sub-queries. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, the user wants a Python script that reads an HDF5 file. So, for the HDF5 Dataset Access part, they're using h5py. They mentioned opening a specific file and accessing a dataset named 'aerosol_optical_thickness_550_ocean'. Also, extracting metadata like long_name and units is important here. I should make sure to include decoding these attributes since they might be in bytes.

Next, the data preprocessing steps involve replacing -999 with NaNs and creating a masked array. This falls under NumPy-based processing. I need to focus on how to handle _FillValue, which in this case is -999, using functions like np.where or np.ma.masked_where. Also, ensuring that the data is properly filtered for visualization.

Lastly, the visualization part uses matplotlib and basemap. They want an orthographic projection with specific coastlines, parallels, and meridians. The plot should be a pseudocolor plot with a colorbar and title. I'll need to detail how to set up the map, add necessary elements, and customize the plot as specified.

I have to make sure each sub-query is clear and targets only its respective domain without overlapping information.
