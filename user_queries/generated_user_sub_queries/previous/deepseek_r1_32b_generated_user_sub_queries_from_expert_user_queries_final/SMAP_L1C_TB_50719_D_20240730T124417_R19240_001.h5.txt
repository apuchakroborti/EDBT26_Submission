        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            I am working with an HDF5 file containing SMAP Level 1C data. 
The script should begin by importing necessary libraries: os, datetime, h5py, numpy as np, matplotlib as mpl, matplotlib.pyplot as plt, and mpl_toolkits.basemap import Basemap.

Define a constant `filename` with the value "SMAP_L1C_TB_50719_D_20240730T124417_R19240_001.h5".

The program should read this HDF5 file in read-only mode. 
Access the main dataset at "/Global_Projection/cell_tb_h_fore" and geolocation datasets at "/Global_Projection/cell_lat" (latitude) and "/Global_Projection/cell_lon" (longitude).

Extract attributes from the cell_tb_h_fore dataset: units, long_name, _FillValue, valid_max, and valid_min. 
Decode these attributes using 'ascii' encoding with 'replace' as the error handling parameter.

Identify invalid data by combining two conditions using numpy's logical_or: values greater than valid_max or less than valid_min. 
Update this mask to include values equal to _FillValue. Replace invalid data in cell_tb_h_fore with NaNs and create a masked array using numpy's masked_where function, checking for NaNs.

For visualization, initialize a Basemap object with a cylindrical projection. Set map boundaries from -90 to 90 latitude and -180 to 180 longitude. 
Add coastlines with a line width of 0.5. Draw parallels at intervals of 45 degrees from  and meridians at the same interval, labeling them as [True, False, False, True].

Create a scatter plot using longitude and latitude coordinates, with data from cell_tb_h_fore, point size 1, colormap 'jet', no edge color, and linewidth 0. 
Add a colorbar below the plot with 10% padding and label it with the units attribute.

Set the plot title to the concatenation of the filename's basename and long_name, using fontsize 7.

Alright, I need to break down the user's query into three specific sub-queries as per their instructions. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, the HDF5 Dataset Access part. The user is working with an HDF5 file and needs to access specific datasets and attributes. They mentioned using h5py, so I should focus on that. The main dataset is at "/Global_Projection/cell_tb_h_fore" and they also need geolocation data from latitude and longitude paths. Additionally, extracting several attributes like units, long_name, _FillValue, valid_max, and valid_min is crucial. These attributes are stored as bytes, so decoding them with 'ascii' and error handling is important.

Next, the NumPy-based Data Preprocessing section. The user wants to handle invalid data by creating a mask using numpy's logical_or for values beyond valid ranges and including _FillValue. They also need to replace invalid data with NaNs and create a masked array. This involves using np.where and np.ma.masked_where functions.

Lastly, the Plotting and Visualization part requires setting up a Basemap with specific projections and boundaries. Adding coastlines, parallels, meridians, and labels is necessary. The scatter plot should use longitude and latitude data with certain styling options, and a colorbar needs to be added below the plot with proper padding and labeling.

I need to ensure each sub-query is clear and targets only its respective domain without overlapping information.

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
How to access an HDF5 file using h5py, read datasets from paths like "/Global_Projection/cell_tb_h_fore", "/Global_Projection/cell_lat", and "/Global_Projection/cell_lon", extract attributes such as units, long_name, _FillValue, valid_max, and valid_min, and decode these attributes using 'ascii' encoding with error handling set to 'replace'.

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
How to identify invalid data in a NumPy array by combining conditions using np.logical_or for values greater than valid_max or less than valid_min, update the mask to include _FillValue, replace invalid data with NaNs, and create a masked array using np.ma.masked_where.

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
How to use Basemap to create a cylindrical projection map with specified boundaries, add coastlines, draw parallels and meridians at 45-degree intervals, create a scatter plot with specific styling, add a colorbar below the plot with padding and labeling, and set the plot title using fontsize.
