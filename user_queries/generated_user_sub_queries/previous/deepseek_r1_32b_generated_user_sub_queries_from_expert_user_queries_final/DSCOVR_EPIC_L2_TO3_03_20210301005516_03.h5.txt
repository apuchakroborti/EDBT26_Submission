        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            A Python script that accesses and visualizes ozone data from a NASA HDF-EOS file named `DSCOVR_EPIC_L2_TO3_03_20210301005516_03.h5`. 
The script should perform the following steps:

1. Import necessary libraries: os, cartopy.crs, matplotlib, matplotlib.pyplot, numpy, mpl_toolkits.basemap, h5py, 
   and LATITUDE_FORMATTER and LONGITUDE_FORMATTER from cartopy.mpl.gridlines.

2. Open the HDF5 file in read-only mode and extract the following datasets:
   - `/Ozone` for ozone data
   - `/Latitude` for latitude coordinates
   - `/Longitude` for longitude coordinates

3. Set attributes such as `units` (expected value: 'DU') and `long_name` (expected value: 'Ozone').

4. Process the ozone data by replacing the static fill value (-999.0) with NaN values using numpy's masked_where function, based on whether the ozone data is not a number.

5. Calculate the midpoint of the latitude and longitude arrays to determine the center point for visualization.

6. Create an orthographic projection map centered at the calculated midpoint using Cartopy's Orthographic class.

7. Plot the ozone data as a scatter plot with parameters:
   - Longitude as x-coordinates
   - Latitude as y-coordinates
   - Ozone values represented by color (using cmap=plt.cm.jet)
   - Marker size of 1
   - Data transformation set to PlateCarree coordinates

8. Add map features including gridlines, coastlines, and degree labels for latitude and longitude.

9. Create a colorbar with a width of 0.022 and padding of 0.01.

Alright, I need to break down the user's query into three specific sub-queries as per their instructions. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, the user is asking about accessing an HDF5 file using h5py. They want to extract ozone data along with latitude and longitude datasets. So, the first sub-query should focus on how to open the file, access these specific datasets, and retrieve their attributes like units and long_name. I'll make sure to mention the exact paths for each dataset.

Next, the preprocessing part involves handling fill values. The user wants to replace -999.0 with NaNs using numpy's masked_where function. So, the second sub-query should cover how to identify these fill values and apply the mask correctly. It's important to specify that this is based on whether the ozone data isn't a number.

Lastly, for visualization, they're using Cartopy to create an orthographic map centered at the midpoint of latitudes and longitudes. The plot needs to be a scatter plot with specific parameters like marker size, color mapping, and coordinate transformation. Additionally, adding gridlines, coastlines, and a colorbar are essential steps here. I'll structure the third sub-query around these visualization elements.

I need to ensure each sub-query is clear and targets only its respective domain without overlapping information. This way, when someone uses these sub-queries with a vector database, they can retrieve relevant documentation or examples efficiently.
