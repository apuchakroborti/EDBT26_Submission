        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            A Python script that processes an HDF5 file containing geospatial data. The script should follow these steps:

1. Import Necessary Libraries: Include libraries for OS operations (os), plotting (matplotlib and matplotlib.pyplot), 
numerical computations (numpy), map projections (mpl_toolkits.basemap), and handling HDF5 files.

2. Define Constants: Set a constant `FILE_NAME` to the path "ICESat_2/ATL11_051911_0321_006_06.h5".

3. Open and Read HDF5 File: 
Open the file in read mode and access the datasets `/pt1/latitude`, `/pt1/longitude`, and `/pt1/h_corr`. 
Extract attributes `units` and `long_name` using decoding with 'ascii' and 'replace', and retrieve `_FillValue` from the h_corr dataset.

4. Data Preprocessing:
   - Convert h_corr data to float.
   - Replace `_FillValue` with numpy NaN.
   - Mask data where values are NaN.

5. Create Map Projection: Use an equidistant cylindrical projection with low resolution, setting latitude from -90 to 90 and longitude from -180 to 180.

6. Customize Map:
   - Add coastlines with a line width of 0.5.
   - Draw parallels at intervals of 30 degrees starting from -90 till 120.
   - Draw meridians every 45 degrees from -180 to 180.

7. Generate Scatter Plot: Create a scatter plot using longitude and latitude coordinates, with data as the color variable. Use a marker size of 0.1, jet colormap, no edge colors, and no line widths.

8. Add Colorbar and Title:
   - Attach a colorbar below the map, labeled with the dataset's units.
   - Set the title to include the file basename, dataset path, and long_name from attributes.

Okay, so I need to break down this user query into three specific sub-queries. Let me read through the user's request carefully.

The user wants a Python script that processes an HDF5 file with geospatial data. The steps include importing libraries, defining constants, opening and reading the HDF5 file, preprocessing data, creating a map projection, customizing the map, generating a scatter plot, adding a colorbar, and setting a title.

First, I'll tackle the HDF5 Dataset Access part. They mention using h5py to open an HDF5 file with specific paths like '/pt1/latitude', etc., extracting attributes such as units and long_name, and getting _FillValue from h_corr. So the sub-query should focus on accessing these datasets and their metadata.

Next is NumPy-based Data Preprocessing. The steps involve converting data to float, replacing _FillValue with NaNs, and masking those values. I need to make sure the sub-query includes handling _FillValue and using numpy functions for preprocessing.

Lastly, Map Plotting and Visualization. They want to use matplotlib or basemap for creating a map with specific projections, adding coastlines, parallels, meridians, a scatter plot, colorbar, and title. The sub-query should cover all these visualization aspects.

I need to ensure each sub-query is clear and targets the specific technical domain without overlapping information.
