        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            1. Import Necessary Libraries:  
   Import the required libraries for handling operating system functions, creating visualizations, numerical computations, map projections, and working with HDF5 files: `os`, `matplotlib`, `matplotlib.pyplot`, `numpy`, and `mpl_toolkits.basemap`.

2. Define Constants:  
   Define a constant `FILE_NAME` with the value `'ATL22_20210712003905_02811201_003_01.h5'`, which specifies the HDF5 file to be processed.

3. Open the HDF5 File and Access Datasets:  
   Open the HDF5 file in read mode and access the following datasets:  
   - `/gt1l/transect_lat` for latitude data.  
   - `/gt1l/transect_lon` for longitude data.  
   - `/gt1l/inland_water_body_type` for the main data.  

   Read the attributes `units`, `long_name` (decoded using `decode('ascii', 'replace')`), and `_FillValue` from the inland_water_body_type dataset.

4. Data Processing and Cleaning:  
   Convert the main data to a float type using `.astype(float)`. Replace the `_FillValue` with `numpy.NaN` and mask the data using `numpy.ma.masked_where(numpy.isnan(data), data)`.

5. Create a Map:  
   Create an equidistant cylindrical projection map with low resolution, setting latitude and longitude bounds from -90 to 90 and -180 to 180, respectively. 
   Add coastlines with a line width of 0.5, parallels at intervals of [-90, -60, -30, 0, 30, 60, 90], and meridians at intervals of [-180, -135, -90, -45, 0, 45, 90, 135, 180].

6. Scatter Plot:  
   Use the `scatter` function to plot the data on the map with parameters: longitude, latitude, `c=data`, marker size `s=0.1`, colormap `plt.cm.jet`, and no edge colors or linewidth.

7. Add Colorbar and Title:  
   Add a colorbar to the map, positioned at the bottom, labeled with the main dataset's `units`. 
   Set the title of the plot to include the file basename, dataset path name, and `long_name` from the attributes.

        Note: return only the the response of sub-queries only based on the below format, not explanation, not python code, and node additional text needed

Okay, so I need to break down the user's query into three specific sub-queries. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, looking at the HDF5 Dataset Access section. The user is working with an HDF5 file named 'ATL22_20210712003905_02811201_003_01.h5'. They need to open this file and access specific datasets: '/gt1l/transect_lat', '/gt1l/transect_lon', and '/gt1l/inland_water_body_type'. Also, they want to read certain attributes from the inland dataset, like units, long_name (decoded as ASCII), and _FillValue. So I'll structure this into a sub-query focusing on h5py operations.

Next, for NumPy-based Data Preprocessing, the user converts the main data to float, replaces _FillValue with NaNs, and masks the data using numpy.ma.masked_where. The sub-query should capture these steps, emphasizing handling _FillValue and masking techniques.

Lastly, the Plotting and Visualization part involves creating a map with specific projections, adding coastlines, parallels, meridians, plotting scatter points, and adding a colorbar and title. I'll make sure this sub-query focuses on matplotlib and basemap functionalities without delving into data processing details.

I need to ensure each sub-query is clear and targets the specified technical domains without overlapping information.
