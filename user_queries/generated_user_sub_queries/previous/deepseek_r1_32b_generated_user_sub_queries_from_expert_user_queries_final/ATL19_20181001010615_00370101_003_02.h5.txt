"""
        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            1. Import Libraries: Import necessary libraries including os, matplotlib, matplotlib.pyplot, numpy, and mpl_toolkits.basemap for handling OS functions, plotting, numerical operations, map projections, and HDF5 files.

2. Define Constants: Set the constant `FILE_NAME` to "ATL19_20181001010615_00370101_003_02.h5".

3. Read HDF5 File: Open the HDF5 file in read mode and access datasets at paths `/mid_latitude/latitude`, `/mid_latitude/longitude`, and `/mid_latitude/beam_1/dot_avg`.

4. Extract Attributes: For each dataset, read attributes `units` and `long_name` using decode('ascii', 'replace') and retrieve `_FillValue` from the main data.

5. Data Processing:
   - Convert main data to float type.
   - Replace `_FillValue` with numpy NaN.
   - Mask data where values are NaN using numpy masked_where.

6. Create Map: Initialize a cylindrical projection map with low resolution, setting latitude and longitude ranges from -90 to 90 and -180 to 180 respectively.

7. Add Map Features:
   - Draw coastlines with a line width of 0.5.
   - Add parallels at latitudes [-90, -60, -30, 0, 30, 60, 90, 120] and meridians at longitudes [-180, -135, -90, -45, 0, 45, 90, 135, 180].

8. Adjust Longitude: Before setting pcolormesh the 180 should be subtractted from longitude value and update the longitude existing value 
   Then it adds pcolormesh with parameters longitude, latitude, data, and latlon=True

9. Add Colorbar and Title:
    - Attach a colorbar at the bottom of the map, labeled with the dataset's units.
    - Set the title using the file basename and `long_name` attribute from the dot_avg dataset.

        Note: return only the the response of sub-queries only based on the below format, not explanation, not python code, and node additional text needed

Okay, so I need to break down the user's query into three specific sub-queries. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, looking at the HDF5 Dataset Access section. The user is working with an HDF5 file named "ATL19_20181001010615_00370101_003_02.h5". They want to access datasets at specific paths: '/mid_latitude/latitude', '/mid_latitude/longitude', and '/mid_latitude/beam_1/dot_avg'. Also, they need to extract attributes like 'units' and 'long_name' using decode('ascii', 'replace') and get the _FillValue from the main data. So I'll focus on how to use h5py to open the file, access these datasets, and retrieve their attributes.

Next, for NumPy-based Data Preprocessing, the user wants to convert the data to float, replace _FillValue with NaNs, and then mask those NaN values using np.ma.masked_where. I'll need to outline how to handle each of these steps efficiently in NumPy, ensuring that the preprocessing is done correctly before visualization.

Lastly, the Plotting and Visualization part involves creating a map using matplotlib and basemap. They want a cylindrical projection with specific latitude and longitude ranges. Features like coastlines, parallels, and meridians need to be added. Also, adjusting the longitude by subtracting 180 before plotting and setting up pcolormesh correctly is important. The colorbar should be at the bottom with the dataset's units, and the title should include the file name and long_name attribute.

I'll make sure each sub-query is clear and targets only the specified domains without overlapping information.
