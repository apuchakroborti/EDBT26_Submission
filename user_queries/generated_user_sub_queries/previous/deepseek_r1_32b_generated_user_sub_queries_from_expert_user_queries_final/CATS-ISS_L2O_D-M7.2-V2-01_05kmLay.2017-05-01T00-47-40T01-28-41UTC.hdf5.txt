"""
        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            1. Load an HDF5 file named 'CATS-ISS_L2O_D-M7.2-V2-01_05kmLay.2017-05-01T00-47-40T01-28-41UTC.hdf5' in read-only mode using h5py.

2. Import necessary libraries: datetime, os, matplotlib (including pyplot and toolkits), numpy, sys, time, and colors.

3. Access the following datasets from the HDF5 file:
   - '/layer_descriptor/Aerosol_Type_Fore_FOV' as a 2D array for aerosol type information.
   - '/geolocation/CATS_Fore_FOV_Latitude' and '/geolocation/CATS_Fore_FOV_Longitude' as 2D arrays for latitude and longitude values.

4. Extract the first column from the Aerosol_Type_Fore_FOV dataset, the second column from the latitude data, and the second column from the longitude data.

5. Create a discrete color map named 'cmap' with nine colors: "grey", "blue", "aqua", "yellow", "orange", "green", "red", "black", and "brown".

6. Set up a geographic map using a cylindrical projection with low resolution, latitude range from -90 to 90, longitude range from -180 to 180, 
   coastlines with linewidth 0.5, parallels at [-90, 0, 45, 60, 75, 90], and meridians at [-180, -120, -60, 0, 60, 120, 180] with labels [True, False, False, True].

7. Create a scatter plot using longitude and latitude data with parameters: c=data, s=0.1, cmap='jet', edgecolors=None, linewidth=0.

8. Set the plot title to the basename of the HDF5 file.

9. Define bins for the colorbar using numpy.linspace(0, 9, 10) and normalize using matplotlib.colors.BoundaryNorm with bounds and N=9.

10. Create a second axes object (ax2) at position [0.1, 0.1, 0.8, 0.02] and add a horizontal colorbar with parameters: ax=ax2, cmap=cmap, normalize=normalize, orientation='horizontal', spacing='proportional', ticks=bounds, boundaries=bounds, format='%1i'.

11. Set x-tick labels for the colorbar as ["invalid", "marine", "p. marine", "dust", "dust mixture", "clean/bg", "p. continental", "smoke", "volcanic"] with font size 5.

Alright, I need to break down the user's query into three specific sub-queries as per their instructions. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, looking at the HDF5 Dataset Access section. The user wants to load a specific HDF5 file and access certain datasets. They mention using h5py in read-only mode, so I should focus on that. The datasets they need are Aerosol_Type_Fore_FOV, Latitude, and Longitude. Also, extracting specific columns from these datasets is part of this step.

Next, the NumPy-based Data Preprocessing section involves handling _FillValue, which suggests dealing with missing or invalid data. They also want to create a color map with nine specific colors. This sub-query should cover how to apply masks using NumPy functions and set up the color map correctly.

Lastly, for Plotting and Visualization, the user wants to use matplotlib with a cylindrical projection. They specified setting up coastlines, meridians, parallels, and adding a colorbar. I need to ensure this sub-query includes all these elements, like creating the scatter plot, setting the title, and configuring the colorbar as described.

I should make sure each sub-query is clear and targets only its specific domain without overlapping with others. That way, when someone uses these sub-queries, they can efficiently find relevant information or code snippets for each part of their task.
