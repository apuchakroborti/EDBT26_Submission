        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            A Python script that visualizes data from an HDF5 file by following these structured steps:

1. Import necessary libraries: os, matplotlib, matplotlib.pyplot, numpy, mpl_toolkits.basemap, and h5py.

2. Load Data:
   - Open the HDF5 file using h5py.
   - Extract datasets:
     - 'solarAzimuthAngle' from path /S2/solarAzimuthAngle.
     - 'latitude' from path /S2/Latitude.
     - 'longitude' from path /S2/Longitude.
   - Retrieve attributes 'units' and '_FillValue' from the solarAzimuthAngle dataset.

3. Process Solar Azimuth Angle Data:
   - Replace _FillValue with NaN in the solarAzimuthAngle data.
   - Mask NaN values to handle missing data appropriately.

4. Create Map and Plot Data:
   - Initialize a cylindrical map projection using Basemap.
   - Set map boundaries with low resolution, latitude range from -90 to 90, and longitude range from -180 to 180.
   - Add coastlines with line width 0.5.
   - Draw parallels at intervals of every 45 degrees (using numpy.arange for values -90, 91) and meridians at the same intervals with labels [True, False, False, True].

5. Add Colorbar and Title:
   - Use matplotlib's scatter function to plot longitude and latitude data points.
   - Apply colormap plt.cm.jet with no edge color and linewidth 0.
   - Create a colorbar below the plot with padding of 10% and label it using the 'units' attribute from solarAzimuthAngle.

Alright, I need to break down the user's query into three specific sub-queries as per their instructions. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, looking at the HDF5 Dataset Access section. The user wants to open an HDF5 file and extract specific datasets along with their attributes. So, the sub-query should focus on using h5py to access these datasets and retrieve the necessary attributes like 'units' and '_FillValue'. I'll make sure to mention the exact paths for each dataset.

Next, the NumPy-based Data Preprocessing part involves handling missing data. The user needs to replace _FillValue with NaNs and then mask those values. This sub-query should specifically address these steps using NumPy functions like np.where and np.ma.masked_where.

Lastly, for Map Plotting and Visualization, the focus is on setting up a map projection, adding geographical features, and creating a colorbar. I'll include details about initializing the Basemap with cylindrical projection, setting boundaries, adding coastlines, parallels, meridians, and configuring the colorbar as specified.

I need to ensure each sub-query is clear and concise, targeting only the relevant technical aspects without any extra information.

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
How to open an HDF5 file using h5py and extract datasets 'solarAzimuthAngle', 'latitude', and 'longitude' from their respective paths. Also, retrieve attributes 'units' and '_FillValue' from the solarAzimuthAngle dataset.

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
How to replace _FillValue with NaN in a NumPy array and mask NaN values using np.where or np.ma.masked_where for handling missing data.

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
How to create a cylindrical map projection using Basemap, set map boundaries, add coastlines, parallels, and meridians. Also, how to plot data points with a colorbar using matplotlib's scatter function and apply a colormap.
