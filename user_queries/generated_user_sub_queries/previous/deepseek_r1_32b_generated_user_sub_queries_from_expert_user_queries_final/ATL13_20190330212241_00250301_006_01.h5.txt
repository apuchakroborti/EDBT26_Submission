        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            A Python script that processes an HDF5 file to generate a geospatial visualization. The script follows these steps:

1. Import Libraries: Include necessary modules for OS operations (os), plotting (matplotlib and matplotlib.pyplot), 
numerical computations (numpy), map projections (mpl_toolkits.basemap), and handling HDF5 files.

2. Define Constants: Set the FILE_NAME constant to "ATL13_20190330212241_00250301_006_01.h5".

3. Open HDF5 File: Open the file in read mode and access datasets at paths "/gt1l/segment_lat", "/gt1l/segment_lon", and "/gt1l/segment_geoid" 
   for latitude, longitude, and main data respectively.

4. Extract Attributes: From the segment_geoid dataset, read 'units' and 'long_name' attributes using decode('ascii', 'replace') and retrieve '_FillValue' from the main data. 
   Convert segment_geoid data to float type.

5. Data Processing:
   - Replace _FillValue in segment_geoid data with numpy NaN.
   - Mask data where values are NaN using numpy's masked_where function.

6. Map Setup: Create a cylindrical projection map with low resolution, setting latitude and longitude bounds from -90 to 90 and -180 to 180 respectively. 
   Add coastlines with line width 0.5, parallels at intervals [-90, -60, -30, 0, 30, 60, 90, 120], and meridians at intervals [-180, -135, -90, -45, 0, 45, 90, 135, 180].

7. Adjust Longitude: Subtract 180 degrees from longitude values before plotting.

8. Plot Data: Use scatter plot with parameters: longitude and latitude coordinates, data as color values (c=data), marker size 0.1, colormap 'jet', no edge colors, and zero linewidth.

9. Add Visualization Elements:
   - Include a colorbar at the bottom labeled with the main dataset's units.
   - Set the title to include the HDF5 file's basename and its long_name attribute.

This structured approach ensures clarity for code generation by an LLM.

Okay, so I need to break down this user query into three specific sub-queries. The user provided a detailed Python script outline for processing an HDF5 file and generating a geospatial visualization. My task is to extract the relevant parts for each of the three domains: HDF5 access, NumPy preprocessing, and plotting.

First, looking at the HDF5 Dataset Access part. The user's steps include importing h5py, opening the file, accessing specific datasets by their paths, extracting attributes like units and long_name, and handling _FillValue. So I need to capture all these aspects in the sub-query. That means mentioning accessing files with .h5 extension, using dataset paths like /gt1l/segment_lat, reading attributes with decode, and retrieving _FillValue.

Next, for NumPy-based Data Preprocessing. The steps involve replacing _FillValue with NaNs and masking data where values are NaN using np.ma.masked_where. Also, converting the segment_geoid data to float type is part of this preprocessing. So the sub-query should focus on handling _FillValue replacement, applying masks, and any other preprocessing like min/max calculations if present.

Lastly, the Map Plotting and Visualization section. The user uses matplotlib and basemap for creating a cylindrical projection map, setting bounds, adding coastlines, parallels, meridians, adjusting longitude by subtracting 180, plotting with scatter, colorbar, title, etc. So the sub-query should cover using these libraries, configuring projections, drawing elements like coastlines, applying colorbars, and setting titles.

I need to make sure each sub-query is clear and focused on its respective domain without overlapping information. Also, I must avoid including any explanations or code snippets, just the specific queries as per the format.
