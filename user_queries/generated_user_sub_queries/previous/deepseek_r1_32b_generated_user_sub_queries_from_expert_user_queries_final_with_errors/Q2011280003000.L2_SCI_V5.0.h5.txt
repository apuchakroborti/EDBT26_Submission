        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            A Python script that visualizes data from an HDF5 file using the following steps:

1. Import Libraries: Include necessary libraries for handling files, numerical operations, and visualization:
   
2. Define Constants: Set the file name constant:
   - `FILE_NAME = 'Q2011280003000.L2_SCI_V5.0.h5'`

3. Open HDF5 File: Open the specified HDF5 file in read-only mode using a `with` statement, assigning it to variable `f`.

4. Access Data and Attributes:
   - Extract the `SSS` dataset from the group `Aquarius Data` into `datavar`.
   - Slice `datavar` to get 1D data by taking all rows from the 0th column.
   - Retrieve attributes `units`, `long_name`, and `_FillValue` from `datavar`, decoding byte-encoded strings.

5. Extract Latitude and Longitude:
   - Access `sclat` as a 1D array for latitude data.
   - Access `sclon` as a 1D array for longitude data.
   both from the group `Navigation`

6. Handle Fill Values:
   - Replace `_FillValue` in the SSS dataset with `NaN` to handle missing data.
   - Create a masked array for efficient management of invalid data points.

7. Create Map Projection:
   - Use Basemap's cylindrical projection with latitude limits from -90 to 90 and longitude from -180 to 180.

8. Generate Scatter Plot:
   - Plot data points on the map using longitude as x and latitude as y coordinates.
   - Apply the `jet` colormap for data representation.

9. Add Colorbar:
   - Create a colorbar with a label based on the SSS dataset's units attribute for clarity.

Okay, I need to break down the user's query into three specific sub-queries as per their instructions. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, the user wants a Python script that visualizes data from an HDF5 file. They've outlined several steps, so I'll focus on extracting the parts relevant to each sub-query.

Starting with the HDF5 Dataset Access: The user mentions opening the file using h5py, accessing specific datasets like 'SSS' under 'Aquarius Data', and retrieving attributes such as units, long_name, and _FillValue. They also access latitude and longitude data from the 'Navigation' group. So, I'll formulate a sub-query that captures all these HDF5 operations.

Next, for NumPy-based Data Preprocessing: The user replaces _FillValue with NaNs and creates a masked array. These steps are about handling missing data and preparing it for visualization. My sub-query should focus on how to handle FillValues and apply masks using NumPy functions.

Lastly, the Plotting and Visualization part involves using Basemap's cylindrical projection, plotting scatter points, adding a colorbar, and setting labels. I'll create a sub-query that addresses these visualization-specific tasks, including map setup and data representation.

I need to ensure each sub-query is clear and targets only its specific domain without overlapping with the others. Let me structure them accordingly.

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
How to access an HDF5 file named 'Q2011280003000.L2_SCI_V5.0.h5' using h5py, extract the SSS dataset from the 'Aquarius Data' group, retrieve attributes like units, long_name, and _FillValue, and access sclat and sclon datasets from the 'Navigation' group.

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
How to replace _FillValue in a NumPy array with NaNs, create a masked array using np.ma.masked_where, and slice a 2D dataset to extract a 1D column of data.

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
How to use Basemap's cylindrical projection to plot geospatial data as a scatter plot with longitude and latitude coordinates, apply the jet colormap, add coastlines, meridians, parallels, and create a colorbar with a label based on dataset units.
