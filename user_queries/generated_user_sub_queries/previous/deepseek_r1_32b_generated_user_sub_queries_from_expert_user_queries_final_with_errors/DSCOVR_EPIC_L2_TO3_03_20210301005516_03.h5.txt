        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            A Python script that accesses and visualizes ozone data from a NASA HDF-EOS file named `DSCOVR_EPIC_L2_TO3_03_20210301005516_03.h5`. 
The script should perform the following steps:

1. Open the HDF5 file in read-only mode and extract the following datasets:
   - `/Ozone` for ozone data
   - `/Latitude` for latitude coordinates
   - `/Longitude` for longitude coordinates

2. Set attributes such as `units` (expected value: 'DU') and `long_name` (expected value: 'Ozone').

3. Process the ozone data by replacing the static fill value (-999.0) with NaN values using numpy's masked_where function, based on whether the ozone data is not a number.

4. Calculate the midpoint of the latitude and longitude arrays to determine the center point for visualization.

5. Create an orthographic projection map centered at the calculated midpoint using Cartopy's Orthographic class.

6. Plot the ozone data as a scatter plot with parameters:
   - Longitude as x-coordinates
   - Latitude as y-coordinates
   - Ozone values represented by color (using cmap=plt.cm.jet)
   - Marker size of 1
   - Data transformation set to PlateCarree coordinates

7. Add map features including gridlines, coastlines, and degree labels for latitude and longitude.

8. Create a colorbar with a width of 0.022 and padding of 0.01.

Alright, I need to break down the user's query into three specific sub-queries as per their instructions. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, looking at the HDF5 Dataset Access section. The user wants to open a specific HDF-EOS file and extract certain datasets. They also mention setting attributes like units and long_name. So I should focus on how to use h5py to access these datasets and their metadata.

Next, for NumPy-based Data Preprocessing, the task is about replacing fill values with NaNs using masked_where. The user expects handling of -999.0 as invalid data. I need to ensure the sub-query clearly states this preprocessing step without getting into code specifics.

Lastly, the Plotting and Visualization part involves creating a map with Cartopy's Orthographic projection. They want specific features like gridlines, coastlines, and a colorbar. I should make sure each of these elements is addressed in the sub-query.

I'll structure each sub-query to target only the relevant technical domain without overlapping information.
