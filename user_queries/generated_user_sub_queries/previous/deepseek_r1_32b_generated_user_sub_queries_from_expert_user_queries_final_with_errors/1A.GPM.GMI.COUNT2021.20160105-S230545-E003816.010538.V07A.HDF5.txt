        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            A Python script that visualizes data from an HDF5 file by following these structured steps:

1. Load Data:
   - Open the HDF5 file using h5py.
   - Extract datasets:
     - 'solarAzimuthAngle'
     - 'latitude'
     - 'longitude' from the group S2
   - Retrieve attributes 'unit' and 'FillValue' from the solarAzimuthAngle dataset.

2. Process Solar Azimuth Angle Data:
   - Replace _FillValue with NaN in the solarAzimuthAngle data.
   - Mask NaN values to handle missing data appropriately.

3. Create Map and Plot Data:
   - Initialize a cylindrical map projection using Basemap.
   - Set map boundaries with low resolution, latitude range from -90 to 90, and longitude range from -180 to 180.
   - Add coastlines with line width 0.5.
   - Draw parallels at intervals of every 45 degrees from -90 to 90 and meridians at the same intervals with left and bottom labels.

4. Add Colorbar and Title:
   - Use matplotlib's scatter function to plot longitude and latitude data points.
   - Apply colormap plt.cm.jet with no edge color and linewidth 0.
   - Create a colorbar below the plot with padding of 10% and label it using the 'units' attribute from solarAzimuthAngle.

Alright, I need to break down the user's query into three specific sub-queries as per their instructions. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, looking at the HDF5 Dataset Access section. The user wants to open an HDF5 file using h5py and extract specific datasets from a group called S2. They also need to retrieve attributes like 'unit' and 'FillValue'. So I'll focus on how to access these elements using h5py.

Next, for NumPy-based Data Preprocessing, the task is about handling _FillValue by replacing it with NaNs and masking those values. I should think about how to use numpy functions like np.where or masked arrays to achieve this.

Lastly, the Plotting and Visualization part involves setting up a map using Basemap, adding coastlines, parallels, meridians, plotting data points, and creating a colorbar. I'll need to structure the sub-query around these visualization steps without getting into code specifics.

I should ensure each sub-query is clear and targets only its specific domain as instructed.
