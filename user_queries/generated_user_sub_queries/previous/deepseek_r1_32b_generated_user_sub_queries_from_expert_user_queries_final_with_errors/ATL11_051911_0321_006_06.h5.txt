        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            A Python script that processes an HDF5 file containing geospatial data. The script should follow these steps:

1. Define Constants: Set a constant `FILE_NAME` to the path "ATL11_051911_0321_006_06.h5".

2. Open and Read HDF5 File: 
Open the file in read mode and access the datasets `latitude`, `longitude`, and `h_corr` from `pt1`. 
Extract attributes `Units` and `long name` using decoding with 'ascii' and 'replace', and retrieve `_Fillvalue` from the h_corr dataset.

3. Data Preprocessing:
   - Convert h_corr data to float.
   - Replace `_Fillvalue` with numpy NaN.
   - Mask data where values are NaN.

4. Create Map Projection: Use an equidistant cylindrical projection with low resolution, setting latitude from -90 to 90 and longitude from -180 to 180.

5. Customize Map:
   - Add coastlines with a line width of 0.5.
   - Draw parallels at intervals of 30 degrees starting from -90 till 120.
   - Draw meridians every 45 degrees from -180 to 180.

6. Generate Scatter Plot: Create a scatter plot using longitude and latitude coordinates, 
   with data as the color variable. Use a marker size of 0.1, jet colormap, no edge colors, and no line widths.

7. Add Colorbar and Title:
   - Attach a colorbar below the map, labeled with the dataset's units.
   - Set the title to include the file basename, dataset path, and long_name from attributes.

Okay, so I need to break down this user query into three specific sub-queries. Let me read through the user's request carefully.

The user wants a Python script that processes an HDF5 file with geospatial data. The steps are outlined clearly: defining constants, opening and reading the HDF5 file, preprocessing data, creating a map projection, customizing the map, generating a scatter plot, and adding a colorbar and title.

First, I'll tackle the HDF5 Dataset Access part. The user mentions using h5py to open the file and access specific datasets like 'latitude', 'longitude', and 'h_corr' from 'pt1'. They also need to extract attributes such as Units and long name with decoding, and retrieve _FillValue from h_corr.

Next is NumPy-based Data Preprocessing. The steps here are converting h_corr data to float, replacing _FillValue with NaNs, and masking the data where values are NaN using numpy functions like np.where or np.ma.masked_where.

Lastly, for Map Plotting and Visualization, the user wants to use matplotlib along with basemap or cartopy. They need an equidistant cylindrical projection, adding coastlines, parallels every 30 degrees from -90 to 120, meridians every 45 degrees, a scatter plot with specific parameters, and then add a colorbar and title using attributes from the HDF5 file.

I'll structure each sub-query focusing on these areas without overlapping. Each should be clear and specific so that relevant documentation can be retrieved.

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
How to use h5py to open an HDF5 file named "ATL11_051911_0321_006_06.h5" and access the datasets 'latitude', 'longitude', and 'h_corr' from the group 'pt1'? Also, how to extract attributes like Units and long name with decoding using 'ascii' and 'replace', and retrieve _FillValue from the h_corr dataset.

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
How to convert an HDF5 dataset (h_corr) to float in NumPy? How to replace _FillValue with NaNs and mask data where values are NaN using np.where or np.ma.masked_where?

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
How to create a map projection using matplotlib, mpl_toolkits.basemap, or cartopy with an equidistant cylindrical projection? How to add coastlines, parallels every 30 degrees from -90 to 120, meridians every 45 degrees from -180 to 180, and generate a scatter plot with longitude and latitude as coordinates, using a jet colormap, marker size of 0.1, no edge colors or line widths? Also, how to add a colorbar below the map labeled with dataset units and set the title with file basename, dataset path, and long_name from attributes.
