        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            A Python script that processes an HDF5 file to generate a geospatial visualization. The script follows these steps:

1. Define Constants: Set the FILE_NAME constant to "ATL13_20190330212241_00250301_006_01.h5".

2. Open HDF5 File: Open the file in read mode and access datasets at paths "/segment_lat", "/segment_lon", and "/segment_geoid" 
   for latitude, longitude, and main data respectively from `gt1l`.

3. Extract Attributes: From the segment_geoid dataset, read 'units' and 'long name' attributes using decode('ascii', 'replace') and retrieve '_Fillvalue' from the main data. 
   Convert segment_geoid data to float type.

4. Data Processing:
   - Replace _Fillvalue in segment_geoid data with numpy NaN.
   - Mask data where values are NaN using numpy's masked_where function.

5. Map Setup: Create a cylindrical projection map with low resolution, setting latitude and longitude bounds from -90 to 90 and -180 to 180 respectively. 
   Add coastlines with line width 0.5, 
   parallels at intervals [-90, -60, -30, 0, 30, 60, 90, 120], 
   and meridians at intervals [-180, -135, -90, -45, 0, 45, 90, 135, 180].

6. Adjust Longitude: Subtract 180 degrees from longitude values before plotting.

7. Plot Data: Use scatter plot with parameters: longitude and latitude coordinates, data as color values (c=data), marker size 0.1, colormap 'jet', no edge colors, and zero linewidth.

8. Add Visualization Elements:
   - Include a colorbar at the bottom labeled with the main dataset's units.
   - Set the title to include the HDF5 file's basename and its long_name attribute.

Okay, I need to break down the user's query into three specific sub-queries. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, the user is working with an HDF5 file using Python. They mention opening the file, accessing specific datasets like "/segment_lat", and extracting attributes such as 'units' and 'long name'. So for the HDF5 Dataset Access sub-query, I should focus on how to use h5py to open the file, access these datasets by their paths, and retrieve the necessary attributes. Also, they need to get the _FillValue from the main data, so that's part of this section.

Next, the data processing steps involve handling the _FillValue. They replace it with NaNs using NumPy and then mask the data where values are NaN. This clearly falls under the NumPy-based Data Preprocessing sub-query. I should include how to handle _FillValue replacement and masking techniques like np.where or np.ma.masked_where.

Lastly, for visualization, they're setting up a map using matplotlib with specific projections, coastlines, parallels, and meridians. They also adjust longitude by subtracting 180 degrees before plotting. The plot uses a scatter method with certain parameters, adds a colorbar, and sets the title dynamically based on file attributes. So the Plotting sub-query should cover all these aspects: setting up the map projection, adjusting data for plotting, creating the scatter plot, adding colorbars, labels, and titles.

I need to make sure each sub-query is clear and focused only on its domain without overlapping with others.
