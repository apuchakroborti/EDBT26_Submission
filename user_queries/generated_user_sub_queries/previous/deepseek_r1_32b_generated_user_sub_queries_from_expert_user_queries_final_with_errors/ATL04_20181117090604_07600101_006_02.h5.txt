        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            A Python script to process and visualize data from an HDF5 file. The script should:
1. Define a constant FILE_NAME pointing to the HDF5 file located at "ATL04_20181117090604_07600101_006_02.h5".
2. Open the HDF5 file in read mode and access three datasets:
   - `/latitude` for latitude data, `longitude` for longitude data, and `dem_h` for the data from the root group `profile_1`
3. Extract attributes from the dem_h dataset:
   - 'unit' and 'long name' using decode('ascii', 'replace')
   - 'FillValue'
4. Process the main data by converting it to float, replacing `FillValue` with numpy NaN, and masking NaN values using numpy.ma.masked_where.
5. Create a map using an equidistant cylindrical projection with low resolution, setting latitude bounds from -90 to 90 and longitude bounds from -180 to 180.
6. Customize the map by adding:
   - Coastlines with a line width of 0.5
   - Parallels at latitudes [-90, -60, -30, 0, 30, 60, 90]
   - Meridians at longitudes [-180, -135, -90, -45, 0, 45, 90, 135, 180]
7. Generate a scatter plot on the map with parameters:
   - x = longitude data
   - y = latitude data
   - c = main data
   - marker size (s) of 0.1
   - colormap 'jet'
   - no edge colors or linewidth
8. Add a colorbar to the bottom of the map, labeled with the units from the main dataset.
9. Set the title of the visualization to include the base filename and long_name attribute of the main dataset.

Okay, I need to break down the user's query into three specific sub-queries. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, the HDF5 Dataset Access part. The user wants to open a specific file and access certain datasets. They mentioned using h5py, so I should focus on that. The script needs to define FILE_NAME pointing to an HDF5 file. Then, it should open the file in read mode and access three datasets: latitude, longitude, and dem_h from profile_1. Also, extracting attributes like unit, long name, and FillValue using decode is important here.

Next, for NumPy-based Data Preprocessing, the main tasks are converting data to float, replacing FillValue with NaNs, and masking them. The user specified using np.where and np.ma.masked_where, so I need to make sure those functions are highlighted in this sub-query.

Lastly, the Plotting and Visualization part involves creating a map with specific projections and adding elements like coastlines, parallels, meridians, and a colorbar. Using matplotlib or cartopy is mentioned, so that's the focus here. The scatter plot parameters and the title setup using the filename and attributes are key points to include.

I should ensure each sub-query is clear and targets only its specific domain without overlapping with others.
