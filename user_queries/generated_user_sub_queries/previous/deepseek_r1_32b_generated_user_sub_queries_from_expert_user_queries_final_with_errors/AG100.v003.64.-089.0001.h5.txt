        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            A Python script that reads an HDF5 file containing ASTER GED data, extracts specific datasets, and visualizes them on a map.

1. Read the input HDF5 file in read-only mode.

2. Extract datasets:
   - 'Mean Emissivity for Band 10' from '/Emissivity/Mean' as a 2D slice (1st index along x-axis).
   - Retrieve the Description attribute's 0th value.
   - Set units to None and long name to 'Mean emissivity for Band 10'.

3. Extract geolocation data:
   - Latitude from 'Latitude'.
   - Longitude from 'Longitude'.

4. Process mean data:
   - Replace -9999 with NaN.
   - Scale by multiplying with 0.001.
   - Apply mask using numpy's masked_where.

5. Create an equidistant cylindrical projection map with Basemap, setting latitude (62.5-64.5) and longitude (89.5-87.5) ranges.

6. Add map features:
   - Coastlines with linewidth 0.5.
   - Parallels at 62, 63, 64 with left labels only
   - Meridians at -89, -88, -87 with bottom labels only

7. Plot data using pcolormesh with latlon=True.

8. Add colorbar labeled 'None' and a title combining the filename's base name with 'Mean Emissivity for Band 10'.

Okay, so I need to break down this user query into three specific sub-queries. Let me read through the problem again to make sure I understand each part.

The user wants a Python script that does several things: reads an HDF5 file with ASTER GED data, extracts some datasets, processes them, and then visualizes them on a map. The task is to split this into three parts focusing on HDF5 access, NumPy preprocessing, and plotting.

First, for the HDF5 part, I need to identify all the steps related to accessing the file and extracting datasets. That includes opening the file in read-only mode, extracting specific datasets like 'Mean Emissivity for Band 10' from a particular path, getting attributes such as the Description, and retrieving geolocation data (latitude and longitude). So the sub-query should cover all these aspects using h5py.

Next, the NumPy preprocessing part involves handling the mean data. This includes replacing -9999 values with NaNs, scaling the data by multiplying with 0.001, and applying a mask using numpy's masked_where function. I need to make sure this sub-query focuses solely on these processing steps without mentioning how the data is accessed or visualized.

Lastly, for plotting and visualization, the user wants to create a map using Basemap with an equidistant cylindrical projection. The map should have specific latitude and longitude ranges, coastlines, parallels, meridians, and use pcolormesh to plot the data. Additionally, adding a colorbar and title are part of this step. So the sub-query here should cover all these visualization aspects using matplotlib and Basemap.

I need to ensure each sub-query is clear and focused on its respective domain without overlapping with other parts. Let me structure them accordingly.

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
How to read an HDF5 file in Python, extract specific datasets like 'Mean Emissivity for Band 10' from '/Emissivity/Mean', retrieve attributes such as Description, and access geolocation data (Latitude and Longitude) using h5py.

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
How to replace -9999 values with NaN in a NumPy array, scale the data by multiplying with 0.001, and apply a mask using numpy's masked_where function for preprocessing ASTER GED mean emissivity data.

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
How to create an equidistant cylindrical projection map using Basemap, add coastlines, parallels at 62, 63, 64 with left labels, meridians at -89, -88, -87 with bottom labels, plot data with pcolormesh, and add a colorbar and title in Python.
