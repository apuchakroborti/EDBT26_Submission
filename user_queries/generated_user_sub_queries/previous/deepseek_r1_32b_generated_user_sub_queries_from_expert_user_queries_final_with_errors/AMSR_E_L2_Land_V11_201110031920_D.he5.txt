        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            A Python script that reads an HDF5 file and generates a map visualization by following these steps:

1. Read HDF5 File: Open the file `AMSR_E_L2_Land_V11_201110031920_D.he5` in read-only mode.

2. Extract Data:
   - Retrieve main data from the attribute 'SoilMoistureSCA' at `AMSR-E Level 2 Land Data/Data/Combined NPD and SCA Output Fields`.
   - Extract latitude data, longitude data from the group `/HDFEOS/POINTS/AMSR-E Level 2 Land Data/Data/Combined NPD and SCA Output Fields`.

3. Data Cleaning:
   - Assign a static `FillValue` of -9999.0.
   - Replace values matching `FillValue` with numpy NaN.
   - Mask data using numpy's masked_array where values are not NaN.

4. Create Map:
   - Use an equidistant cylindrical projection with low resolution.
   - Set latitude range from -90 to 90 and longitude from -170 to 190.
   - Add coastlines with a linewidth of 0.5.
   - Draw parallels to every 45 degree from -90 to 90 and left labels.
   - Draw meridians to every 45 degree from -180 to 180 and bottom labels.

5. Scatter Plot:
   - Use longitude and latitude data.
   - Set parameters: marker size (s=0.1), colormap (plt.cm.jet), edgecolors=None, linewidth=0.

6. Add Colorbar and Title:
   - Include a colorbar labeled with the dataset's units.
   - Set title to include the file basename and 'SoilMoistureSCA'.

Okay, I need to break down the user's query into three specific sub-queries. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, the HDF5 Dataset Access. The user wants to open a specific HE5 file in read-only mode. They also need to retrieve data from certain paths and extract latitude and longitude. So I'll focus on using h5py for accessing these datasets and attributes.

Next, the NumPy-based Data Preprocessing part. The user mentions replacing FillValue with NaNs and masking the data. I should outline how to handle this using numpy functions like where and masked_array.

Lastly, the Map Plotting and Visualization. They want a scatter plot on a specific map projection with coastlines, meridians, parallels, colorbar, and title. I'll need to detail each of these steps using matplotlib and possibly cartopy or basemap.

I should make sure each sub-query is clear and targets only its respective domain without overlapping.

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
How to open an HDF5 file named AMSR_E_L2_Land_V11_201110031920_D.he5 in read-only mode using h5py, retrieve the 'SoilMoistureSCA' attribute from the path '/AMSR-E Level 2 Land Data/Data/Combined NPD and SCA Output Fields', and extract latitude and longitude data from the group '/HDFEOS/POINTS/AMSR-E Level 2 Land Data/Data/Combined NPD and SCA Output Fields'.

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
How to assign a static FillValue of -9999.0, replace values matching FillValue with numpy NaN, and mask data using numpy's masked_array where values are not NaN.

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
How to create a map visualization using matplotlib or cartopy with an equidistant cylindrical projection, set latitude range from -90 to 90 and longitude from -170 to 190, add coastlines with linewidth 0.5, draw parallels every 45 degrees from -90 to 90 with left labels, draw meridians every 45 degrees from -180 to 180 with bottom labels, create a scatter plot using longitude and latitude data with marker size s=0.1, colormap plt.cm.jet, edgecolors=None, linewidth=0, add a colorbar labeled with the dataset's units, and set the title to include the file basename and 'SoilMoistureSCA'.
