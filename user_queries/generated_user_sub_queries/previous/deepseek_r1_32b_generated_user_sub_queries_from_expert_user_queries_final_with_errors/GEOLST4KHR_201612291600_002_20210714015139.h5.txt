        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            A Python script that reads an HDF5 file and generates a map visualization following these steps:

1. Read HDF5 File: Open the HDF5 file in read-only mode.

2. Extract Data and Attributes:
   - Extract datasets including `/lst` (data of interest), `/lon` (longitude values), and `/lat` (latitude values).
   - Update data types for `/lst`, `/lon`, and `/lat` to `np.float64`.
   - Extract attributes: 'scale_factor', 'add_offset', 'units' (decode using `decode()`), '_FillValue', and 'long_name' (description, decode using `decode()`).

3. Preprocess Data:
   - Replace `_FillValue` in `/lst` data with `np.NaN`.
   - Apply scaling: `lst_data = scale_factor  lst_data + add_offset`.
   - Mask data using `numpy.masked_array` with `np.isnan` for `/lst`, `/lat`, and `/lon`.

4. Create Map Visualization:
   - Use an equidistant cylindrical projection with low resolution.
   - Set latitude bounds from -90 to 90 and longitude bounds from -180 to 180.
   - Add coastlines with a line width of 0.5.
   - Draw parallels at intervals of [-90, -60, -30, 0, 30, 60, 90, 120] and meridians at intervals of [-180, -135, -90, -45, 0, 45, 90, 135, 180].
   - Use `scatter` function with parameters: longitude, latitude, data, marker size 0.1, colormap `plt.cm.jet`, no edge colors, and linewidth 0.
   - Add a colorbar with label set to the decoded 'units' attribute.

Okay, so I need to break down this user query into three specific sub-queries. Let me read through the problem again to make sure I understand each part.

The user wants a Python script that does several things: reads an HDF5 file, extracts certain datasets and attributes, preprocesses the data, and then visualizes it on a map. They've given detailed steps for each of these parts.

First, I'll tackle the HDF5 Dataset Access sub-query. The user mentions using h5py to open the file in read-only mode. Then they need to extract specific datasets like /lst, /lon, and /lat. Also, extracting attributes such as 'scale_factor', '_FillValue', etc., is important. So I should focus on how to access these elements using h5py.

Next, for the NumPy-based Data Preprocessing sub-query, the steps involve replacing _FillValue with NaNs, applying a scale factor and offset, and masking data where necessary. This part needs to cover handling missing values, scaling data correctly, and using numpy functions like masked_array or isnan.

Lastly, the Map Plotting and Visualization sub-query requires setting up a map using matplotlib or similar libraries. The user specified an equidistant cylindrical projection, adding coastlines, parallels, meridians, and using scatter to plot points with specific parameters. I should focus on how to configure these elements in Python for geospatial visualization.

I need to make sure each sub-query is clear and targets the right technical domain without overlapping too much. Let me structure each part accordingly.

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
How to replace _FillValue with NaNs in NumPy arrays, apply scaling using scale_factor and add_offset, and create masked arrays for /lst, /lat, and /lon using np.isnan?

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
How to use matplotlib or cartopy to create a map visualization with an equidistant cylindrical projection, set latitude and longitude bounds, add coastlines, parallels, meridians, and plot data points using scatter with specified parameters?
