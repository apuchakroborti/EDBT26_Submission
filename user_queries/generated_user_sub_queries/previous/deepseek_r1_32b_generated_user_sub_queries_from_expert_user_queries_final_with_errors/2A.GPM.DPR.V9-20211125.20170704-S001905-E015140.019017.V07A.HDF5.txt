        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            A script to visualize precipitation rate data from an HDF5 file by following these steps:

1. Open HDF5 File: Access the hierarchical data file in read-only mode and extract the `precipRateESurface` dataset from the sub-group `/FS/SLV`
    along with its `unit` and `FillValu` attribute.

2. Handle Missing Data: Replace `FillValu` entries with NaNs using numpy's masked_where function to mask the data where values are NaN.

3. Retrieve Geolocation Data: Extract latitude from `Latitude` and longitude from `Longitude` from the root group `FS`.

4. Set Up Map Projection: Create a cylindrical projection with low resolution, spanning latitudes from -90 to 90 and longitudes from -180 to 180.

5. Customize Map: Add coastlines (width 0.5), parallels at [-90, -45, 0, 45, 90], and meridians at [-180, -135, -90, -45, 0, 45, 90, 135, 180] with left and bottom labels.

6. Plot Data: Use a scatter plot with the 'jet' colormap, point size of 1, based on longitude and latitude coordinates.

7. Add Colorbar and Title: Include a colorbar below the plot, labeled with the dataset's units, and set the title to reflect the file and dataset name.

Okay, so I need to break down the user's query into three specific sub-queries. Let me read through their request carefully.

The user wants a script that visualizes precipitation rate data from an HDF5 file. They've outlined seven steps, which include opening the HDF5 file, handling missing data, retrieving geolocation data, setting up a map projection, customizing the map, plotting the data, and adding a colorbar and title.

First, I'll tackle the HDF5 Dataset Access part. The user needs to open an HDF5 file in read-only mode and extract specific datasets and attributes. They mentioned accessing `precipRateESurface` from `/FS/SLV`, along with its unit and FillValue attributes. Also, they need latitude and longitude from the root group's `Latitude` and `Longitude`. So, I'll structure this sub-query to focus on using h5py for file access, extracting datasets by their paths, and retrieving attributes.

Next is NumPy-based Data Preprocessing. The user wants to replace FillValue entries with NaNs using np.masked_where. They also need to handle the data preprocessing steps like masking where values are NaN. So, this sub-query should cover handling _FillValue, applying masks, and any necessary filtering or computations.

Lastly, for Map Plotting and Visualization, the user requires setting up a cylindrical projection with specific lat/lon ranges, adding coastlines, parallels, meridians, and then plotting data as a scatter plot. They also want a colorbar labeled with units and a title. This sub-query should focus on using matplotlib or cartopy for projections, adding map elements like coastlines and grid lines, and customizing the plot's appearance.

I need to ensure each sub-query is clear and targets only its specific domain without overlapping into others. Let me structure them accordingly.
