        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            1. Define Constants: Set the constant `FILE_NAME` to "ATL19_20181001010615_00370101_003_02.h5".

2. Read HDF5 File: Open the HDF5 file in read mode and access datasets at paths `latitude`, `longitude`, and `beam_1/dot_avg` from `mid_latitude`.

3. Extract Attributes: For each dataset, read attributes `units` and `long name` using decode('ascii', 'replace') and retrieve `_FillValue` from the main data.

4. Data Processing:
   - Convert main data to float type.
   - Replace `FillValue` with numpy NaN.
   - Mask data where values are NaN using numpy masked_where.

5. Create Map: Initialize a cylindrical projection map with low resolution, setting latitude and longitude ranges from -90 to 90 and -180 to 180 respectively.

6. Add Map Features:
   - Draw coastlines with a line width of 0.5.
   - Add parallels at latitudes [-90, -60, -30, 0, 30, 60, 90, 120] and meridians at longitudes [-180, -135, -90, -45, 0, 45, 90, 135, 180].

7. Adjust Longitude: Before setting pcolormesh the 180 should be subtractted from longitude value and update the longitude existing value 
   Then it adds pcolormesh with parameters longitude, latitude, data, and latlon=True

8. Add Colorbar and Title:
    - Attach a colorbar at the bottom of the map, labeled with the dataset's units.
    - Set the title using the file basename and `long name` attribute from the dot_avg dataset.

Okay, so I need to break down the user's query into three specific sub-queries. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, looking at the HDF5 Dataset Access section. The user wants to open a specific file and access certain datasets. They mention using h5py, which is the library for handling HDF5 files. So I should focus on how to use h5py to open the file, read the datasets like 'latitude', 'longitude', and 'beam_1/dot_avg'. Also, they need to extract attributes such as units and long name, decoding them with 'ascii' and replacing errors. Plus, retrieving the _FillValue from the main data.

Next, for NumPy-based Data Preprocessing, the steps involve converting data to float, replacing FillValues with NaNs, and masking those NaN values using np.ma.masked_where. So I need a sub-query that addresses these preprocessing steps specifically using NumPy functions.

Lastly, the Map Plotting and Visualization part requires setting up a cylindrical projection map with specific latitude and longitude ranges. Then adding coastlines, parallels, and meridians as specified. There's also an adjustment needed for longitude before plotting with pcolormesh, attaching a colorbar, and setting the title using attributes from the data.

I need to make sure each sub-query is clear and targets only its specific domain without overlapping into others.
