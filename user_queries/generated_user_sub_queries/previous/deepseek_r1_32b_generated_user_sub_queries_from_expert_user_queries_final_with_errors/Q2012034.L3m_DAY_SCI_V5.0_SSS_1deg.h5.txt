        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            - Import necessary libraries

- Define variables for file handling and data storage, including FILE_NAME for the HDF5 file path.

- Read the HDF5 file using h5py, extracting the 'l3m_data' dataset into a variable named datavar.

- Retrieve attributes from l3m_data: data_minimum, data_maximum, and _FillValue.

- Replace _FillValue in l3m_data with NaN values.

- Create invalid_data by identifying values outside the range [data_minimum, data_maximum] using logical OR operations.

- Set metadata variables: units = 'psu' and long_name = 'Sea Surface Salinity'.

- Compare data against valid ranges and set out-of-range values to NaN.

- Initialize a Basemap instance with cylindrical projection, setting resolution to 'l', latitude limits from -90 to 90, and longitude limits from -180 to 180.

- Generate x and y coordinates using meshgrid based on longitude and latitude arrays.

- Add geographical features: coastlines with linewidth 0.5, 
    parallels at intervals of 45 degrees from -90 to 90, 
    and meridians at intervals of 45 degrees from -180 to 180 with specific labels  to left and bottom 
- Create a scatter plot of the data using the 'jet' colormap.

- Append a colorbar to the plot with units labeled as 'psu'.

- Set the plot title using the filename and long_name attributes.

Okay, so I need to break down the user's query into three specific sub-queries. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, looking at the HDF5 Dataset Access section. The user wants to import h5py, define variables for file handling, read an HDF5 file named FILE_NAME, extract the 'l3m_data' dataset into datavar, and retrieve specific attributes like data_minimum, data_maximum, and _FillValue. So I'll structure that as a sub-query focusing solely on these tasks using h5py.

Next, the NumPy-based Data Preprocessing part involves handling _FillValue by replacing it with NaNs. Then, creating invalid_data by identifying values outside the [data_min, data_max] range using logical OR operations. Also, setting metadata variables and ensuring out-of-range values are set to NaN. This sub-query should cover all these preprocessing steps using NumPy functions.

Lastly, for Map Plotting and Visualization, the user needs to initialize a Basemap with specific projections and limits, generate x and y coordinates with meshgrid, add geographical features like coastlines, parallels, and meridians, create a scatter plot with 'jet' colormap, add a colorbar with units, and set the title. I'll make sure this sub-query addresses all these visualization aspects using matplotlib and Basemap.

I need to ensure each sub-query is clear and focused on its respective domain without overlapping information.

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
How to use h5py to read an HDF5 file named FILE_NAME, extract the 'l3m_data' dataset into a variable called datavar, and retrieve attributes data_minimum, data_maximum, and _FillValue from l3m_data.

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
How to replace _FillValue in a NumPy array with NaN values, create a mask for invalid data using logical OR operations where values are outside the range [data_minimum, data_maximum], and set out-of-range values to NaN while setting metadata variables units='psu' and long_name='Sea Surface Salinity'.

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
How to use matplotlib and Basemap to initialize a cylindrical projection map with resolution 'l', add coastlines, parallels at 45-degree intervals from -90 to 90, meridians at 45-degree intervals from -180 to 180 with labels on the left and bottom, create a scatter plot using the 'jet' colormap, add a colorbar labeled with units 'psu', and set the title using filename and long_name attributes.
