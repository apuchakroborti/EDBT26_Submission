        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            A Python script that processes an HDF5 file and generates a split-window plot with specific visualizations.

1. Define Constants: Set `FILE_NAME` to "ATL12_20190330212241_00250301_006_03.h5".

2. Open HDF5 File: Read the file in read mode and access these datasets:
   - `latitude`, `longitude` both from /gpsr/navigation
   - `bg_cnt_50shot_s` and `delta_time` (time data) both from the sub-group path `/atlas/pce1/background`

3. Extract Attributes: For the bg_cnt_50shot_s dataset, read 'unit' and 'long name' attributes using decode('ascii', 'replace').

4. Create Plots:
   - First Plot (Time vs. Counts): 
     - Set figure size to 10x10.
     - Use subplot ax1 at position 2,1,1.
     - Calculate elapsed_time by subtracting the first time value from each time point.
     - Plot elapsed_time vs. main data with blue circles.
     - Label axes with time units and main data units.
     - Set title combining the file name, dataset name, and long name.

   - Second Plot (Trajectory Map):
     - Calculate midpoint latitude (lat_m) and longitude (lon_m).
     - Use cartopy's orthographic projection centered at lat_m and lon_m.
     - Enable gridlines with labels and degrees, minutes, seconds (dms).
     - Display global features and coastlines.
     - Plot trajectory in blue, using Geodetic transformation.
     - Mark the starting point with a red circle and label "START" offset by 200 km.

5. Adjust Layout: Use tight layout with padding of 3.0 for proper spacing.

        Note: return only the the response of sub-queries only based on the below format, not explanation, not python code, and node additional text needed

Okay, I need to break down the user's query into three specific sub-queries as per their instructions. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, the user wants a Python script that processes an HDF5 file and generates a split-window plot. The task involves several steps: defining constants, opening the HDF5 file, extracting data and attributes, creating two plots, and adjusting the layout.

Starting with the first sub-query about HDF5 Dataset Access. I need to focus on using h5py to access the specified datasets and their attributes. The user mentions accessing 'latitude' and 'longitude' from '/gpsr/navigation', and 'bg_cnt_50shot_s' and 'delta_time' from '/atlas/pce1/background'. Also, extracting 'unit' and 'long name' attributes for 'bg_cnt_50shot_s' using decode. So the sub-query should cover opening the file, accessing these datasets by their paths, and reading those specific attributes.

Next, the NumPy-based Data Preprocessing part. The user needs to calculate elapsed_time by subtracting the first time value from each point in delta_time. Then, plotting this against bg_cnt_50shot_s. Also, handling any potential _FillValue, though it's not explicitly mentioned here. So the sub-query should include how to compute elapsed_time using NumPy operations and possibly handle masks or fill values if present.

Lastly, the Plotting and Visualization section. The user wants two plots: a time vs. counts plot and a trajectory map. For the first plot, setting up the figure size, subplot arrangement, labeling axes, and adding a title. For the second plot, using cartopy's orthographic projection centered on midpoints of latitude and longitude, enabling gridlines with DMS format, plotting the trajectory, marking the start point, and adjusting the layout. The sub-query should detail how to create these plots using matplotlib and cartopy, including all specified visual elements.

I need to ensure each sub-query is clear and focused only on its respective domain without overlapping into other areas. Also, avoid any explanations or code; just the sub-queries as per the format.

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
How to use h5py to open an HDF5 file named "ATL12_20190330212241_00250301_006_03.h5" and access the datasets 'latitude' and 'longitude' from '/gpsr/navigation', as well as 'bg_cnt_50shot_s' and 'delta_time' from '/atlas/pce1/background'? Additionally, how to read the 'unit' and 'long name' attributes of the 'bg_cnt_50shot_s' dataset using decode('ascii', 'replace').

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
How to calculate elapsed_time by subtracting the first time value from each time point in delta_time using NumPy? How to handle _FillValue and apply masks using np.where or np.ma.masked_where for preprocessing data?

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
How to create a split-window plot with two subplots using matplotlib, where the first subplot (Time vs. Counts) uses a figure size of 10x10 and the second subplot (Trajectory Map) uses cartopy's orthographic projection centered at calculated midpoints lat_m and lon_m? How to configure gridlines with labels in degrees, minutes, seconds format, plot the trajectory in blue using Geodetic transformation, mark the starting point with a red circle labeled "START" offset by 200 km, and adjust layout with tight_layout padding of 3.0?
