        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            1. Define the constant `FILE_NAME` with the path to the HDF5 file:  
   `ATL08_20210114234518_03361001_006_01.h5`.

2. Open the HDF5 file in read mode and access these datasets:
   - `latitude`
   - `longitude`
   - `dem_h`
   all from the sub group path /gt1l/land_segments
   
3. Extract attributes from `dem_h`:
   - `unit ` and `long name`, decoded using `ascii` with `replace` error handling.
   - `fillValue`.

4. Preprocess the data:
   - Replace `_FillValue` in `dem_h` with `numpy.NaN`.
   - Mask NaN values using `numpy.ma.masked_where` based on `numpy.isnan`.

5. Calculate midpoint coordinates for latitude (`lat_m`) and longitude (`lon_m`).

6. Create a map using Cartopy's orthographic projection:
   - Set central longitude to `lon_m` and central latitude to `lat_m`.
   - Use `ax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection=ccrs)`.

7. Plot the data as a scatter plot:
   - Parameters: `lon`, `lat`, `c=data`, `s=1`, `cmap=plt.cm.jet`, `transform=ccrs.PlateCarree()`.

8. Configure the map:
   - Add gridlines with `ax.gridlines(draw_labels=True, dms=True)`.
   - Include coastlines using `ax.coastlines()`.
   - Disable top and right grid labels.
   - Set xformatter to `LONGITUDE_FORMATTER` and yformatter to `LATITUDE_FORMATTER`.

9. Add a colorbar:
    - Use `plt.colorbar` with `fraction=0.022`, `pad=0.01`.
    - Label it with the units from `dem_h` attributes, font size 8.

10. Set the plot title:
    - Include the file basename and `long name` of `dem_h`.

Okay, I need to break down the user's query into three specific sub-queries as per their instructions. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, looking at the HDF5 Dataset Access section. The user wants to open a specific HDF5 file and access certain datasets within a subgroup. They also need to extract attributes from one of these datasets. So I'll focus on using h5py for opening the file, accessing the datasets like latitude, longitude, dem_h under /gt1l/land_segments, and extracting their attributes such as unit, long name, and fillValue.

Next, the NumPy-based Data Preprocessing part involves handling _FillValue by replacing it with NaNs and then masking those values. I'll make sure to mention using np.where and np.ma.masked_where for this purpose.

Lastly, for Map Plotting and Visualization, the user wants to create a scatter plot on a map using Cartopy's orthographic projection. They also need gridlines, coastlines, specific formatters, and a colorbar with appropriate labels. I'll structure the sub-query around these elements, ensuring all configuration steps are included.

I should make sure each sub-query is clear and only targets its respective domain without overlapping information.
