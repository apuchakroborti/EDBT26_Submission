        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            Step-by-Step Code Requirements
1. Define Constants
   - Set `FILE_NAME` to "ATL12_20190330212241_00250301_006_03.h5".

2. Open HDF5 File and Access Datasets
   - Open the file in read mode.
   - Extract datasets: `latitude`, `longitude`, and `swh` data from the sub group path `/gt1l/ssh_segments`

3. Read Dataset Attributes
   - Retrieve 'units' and 'long name' attributes from the swh dataset, decoding them with ASCII and replacing errors.
   - Extract the '_Fillvalue' attribute from the swh dataset.

4. Data Processing and Cleaning
   - Convert data to float type.
   - Replace _FillValue with numpy NaN.
   - Mask data where values are NaN using numpy's masked_where.

5. Create Map Projection
   - Use an equidistant cylindrical projection.
   - Set resolution to 'low'.
   - Define latitude and longitude bounds from -90 to 90 and -180 to 180, respectively.

6. Customize Map Features
   - Add coastlines with a line width of 0.5.
   - Draw parallels at latitudes from -90 to 120 with interval of 30 degree
   - Draw meridians at longitudes from -180 to 180 with interval of 45 degree

7. Plot Data on Map
   - Use scatter plot with longitude and latitude coordinates.
   - Set marker size (s=0.1), colormap (jet), remove edge colors, and set linewidth to 0.

8. Add Colorbar and Title
   - Attach a colorbar below the map, labeled with dataset units.
   - Set the title to include the filename, dataset path, and long_name attribute.

Alright, I need to break down the user's query into three specific sub-queries as per their instructions. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, looking at the HDF5 Dataset Access section. The user wants to open an HDF5 file and access specific datasets within a subgroup. They also need to read certain attributes from the swh dataset. So I'll focus on using h5py for opening the file, accessing the datasets like latitude, longitude, and swh under '/gt1l/ssh_segments', and retrieving their attributes.

Next, for NumPy-based Data Preprocessing, the user is dealing with handling _FillValue by replacing it with NaNs. They also want to mask these NaN values using numpy functions. Additionally, they need to convert data types to float. I'll structure this sub-query around these preprocessing steps, ensuring each action is clearly addressed.

Lastly, the Plotting and Visualization section requires setting up a map projection using matplotlib or cartopy, adding specific features like coastlines, parallels, and meridians, and then plotting the data with a scatter plot. The colorbar and title need to be added as well. I'll make sure this sub-query covers all these visualization aspects without delving into the data processing part.

I should ensure each sub-query is concise and targets only its specific domain, avoiding any overlap or unnecessary details.
