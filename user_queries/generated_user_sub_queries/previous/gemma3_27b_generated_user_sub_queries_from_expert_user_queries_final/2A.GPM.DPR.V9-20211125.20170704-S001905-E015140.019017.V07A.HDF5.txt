"""
        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
        

Create a script to visualize precipitation rate data from an HDF5 file by following these steps:

1. Import Libraries: Use os, matplotlib, matplotlib.pyplot, numpy, mpl_toolkits.basemap, and h5py.

2. Open HDF5 File: Access the file in read-only mode and extract the `/FS/SLV/precipRateESurface` dataset along with its units and _FillValue attribute.

3. Handle Missing Data: Replace _FillValue entries with NaNs using numpy's masked_where function to mask the data where values are NaN.

4. Retrieve Geolocation Data: Extract latitude from `/FS/Latitude` and longitude from `/FS/Longitude`.

5. Set Up Map Projection: Create a cylindrical projection with low resolution, spanning latitudes from -90 to 90 and longitudes from -180 to 180.

6. Customize Map: Add coastlines (width 0.5), parallels at [-90, -45, 0, 45, 90], and meridians at [-180, -135, -90, -45, 0, 45, 90, 135, 180] with labels [True, False, False, True] with specific labels.

7. Plot Data: Use a scatter plot with the 'jet' colormap, point size of 1, based on longitude and latitude coordinates.

8. Add Colorbar and Title: Include a colorbar below the plot, labeled with the dataset's units, and set the title to reflect the file and dataset name.

        Note: return only the the response of sub-queries only based on the below format, not explanation, not python code, and node additional text needed

        """

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
How to open an HDF5 file using `h5py` in read-only mode, access a specific dataset by its path (e.g., `/FS/SLV/precipRateESurface`), retrieve attribute values (e.g., `_FillValue`, 'units'), and handle potential file access errors.

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
How to use `np.ma.masked_where` to replace specific values (e.g., `_FillValue`) with NaN in a NumPy array, and how to handle masked arrays in subsequent calculations or visualizations.

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
How to create a cylindrical map projection using `mpl_toolkits.basemap` or `cartopy`, configure map boundaries (lat/lon ranges), draw coastlines, parallels, and meridians with specific properties (linewidth, labels), and create a scatter plot with a specified colormap and point size based on latitude and longitude coordinates. Also, how to add a colorbar and title to the plot.
