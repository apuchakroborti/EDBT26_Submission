"""
        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            - Import necessary libraries

- Define variables for file handling and data storage, including FILE_NAME for the HDF5 file path.

- Read the HDF5 file using h5py, extracting the 'l3m_data' dataset into a variable named datavar.

- Retrieve attributes from l3m_data: data_minimum, data_maximum, and _FillValue.

- Replace _FillValue in l3m_data with NaN values.

- Create invalid_data by identifying values outside the range [data_minimum, data_maximum] using logical OR operations.

- Set metadata variables: units = 'psu' and long_name = 'Sea Surface Salinity'.

- Compare data against valid ranges and set out-of-range values to NaN.

- Initialize a Basemap instance with cylindrical projection, setting resolution to 'l', latitude limits from -90 to 90, and longitude limits from -180 to 180.

- Generate x and y coordinates using meshgrid based on longitude and latitude arrays.

- Add geographical features: coastlines with linewidth 0.5, 
    parallels at intervals of 45 degrees from -90 to 90, 
    and meridians at intervals of 45 degrees from -180 to 180 with specific labels  to left and bottom 
- Create a scatter plot of the data using the 'jet' colormap.

- Append a colorbar to the plot with units labeled as 'psu'.

- Set the plot title using the filename and long_name attributes.

        Note: return only the the response of sub-queries only based on the below format, not explanation, not python code, and node additional text needed

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
How to open an HDF5 file using `h5py`, access a specific dataset (e.g., 'l3m_data'), and retrieve dataset attributes such as 'data_minimum', 'data_maximum', and '_FillValue'. How to get the path of a dataset within an HDF5 file.

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
How to replace a specific value (`_FillValue`) in a NumPy array with NaN. How to identify values outside a specified range (defined by `data_minimum` and `data_maximum`) using NumPy's logical operations and create a boolean mask. How to use the mask to set out-of-range values to NaN.

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
How to initialize a Basemap instance with a cylindrical projection, set latitude and longitude limits, and configure resolution. How to draw coastlines, parallels, and meridians on a Basemap plot, including customizing linewidths and labels. How to create a scatter plot with a specified colormap ('jet') on a Basemap, add a colorbar with labels, and set the plot title using variables.
