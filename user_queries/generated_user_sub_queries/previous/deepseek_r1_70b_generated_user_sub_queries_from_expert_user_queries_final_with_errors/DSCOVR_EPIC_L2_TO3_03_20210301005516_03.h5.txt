        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            A Python script that accesses and visualizes ozone data from a NASA HDF-EOS file named `DSCOVR_EPIC_L2_TO3_03_20210301005516_03.h5`. 
The script should perform the following steps:

1. Import necessary libraries: os, cartopy.crs, matplotlib, matplotlib.pyplot, numpy, mpl_toolkits.basemap, h5py, 
   and LATITUDE_FORMATTER and LONGITUDE_FORMATTER from cartopy.mpl.gridlines.

2. Open the HDF5 file in read-only mode and extract the following datasets:
   - `/Ozone` for ozone data
   - `/Latitude` for latitude coordinates
   - `/Longitude` for longitude coordinates

3. Set attributes such as `units` (expected value: 'DU') and `long_name` (expected value: 'Ozone').

4. Process the ozone data by replacing the static fill value (-999.0) with NaN values using numpy's masked_where function, based on whether the ozone data is not a number.

5. Calculate the midpoint of the latitude and longitude arrays to determine the center point for visualization.

6. Create an orthographic projection map centered at the calculated midpoint using Cartopy's Orthographic class.

7. Plot the ozone data as a scatter plot with parameters:
   - Longitude as x-coordinates
   - Latitude as y-coordinates
   - Ozone values represented by color (using cmap=plt.cm.jet)
   - Marker size of 1
   - Data transformation set to PlateCarree coordinates

8. Add map features including gridlines, coastlines, and degree labels for latitude and longitude.

9. Create a colorbar with a width of 0.022 and padding of 0.01.

Okay, so I need to break down this user query into three specific sub-queries. Let me read through the problem again carefully.

The user wants a Python script that accesses and visualizes ozone data from a NASA HDF-EOS file named DSCOVR_EPIC_L2_TO3_03_20210301005516_03.h5. The script has several steps, from importing libraries to processing data and creating a map visualization.

First, I need to identify the three main technical domains here: accessing HDF5 datasets, preprocessing with NumPy, and plotting with geospatial tools.

Starting with HDF5 access. The user mentions using h5py to open the file and extract specific datasets: /Ozone, /Latitude, /Longitude. They also want to set attributes like units and long_name. So the sub-query should focus on how to use h5py for these tasks, including accessing by path and handling metadata.

Next is NumPy preprocessing. The user wants to replace a fill value (-999.0) with NaNs using np.ma.masked_where. They also mention checking if data is not a number. So the sub-query should cover using masked_where, handling fill values, and any other preprocessing logic like min or max calculations.

Lastly, plotting with Cartopy. The user wants an orthographic projection centered on midpoints of latitude and longitude. They need to plot ozone as a scatter with specific parameters, add map features, and create a colorbar. So the sub-query should focus on Cartopy's Orthographic setup, adding gridlines, coastlines, and configuring the colorbar.

I think I've covered all parts. Now, I'll structure each sub-query clearly.

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
How to use h5py to open an HDF5 file in read-only mode and extract datasets such as `/Ozone`, `/Latitude`, and `/Longitude` while accessing their attributes like units and long_name.

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
How to replace the static fill value (-999.0) with NaN values using numpy's masked_where function and check if ozone data is not a number.

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
How to create an orthographic projection map centered at calculated midpoints using Cartopy's Orthographic class, plot ozone data as a scatter plot with specified parameters, add gridlines, coastlines, degree labels, and create a colorbar.
