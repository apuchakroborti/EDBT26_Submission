        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            A Python script that processes and visualizes HDF data using specific libraries and steps.

1. Imports: 
   Include necessary libraries such as `os`, `datetime`, `h5py`, `numpy` as `np`, `matplotlib` as `mpl`, `matplotlib.pyplot` as `plt`, and `Basemap` from `mpl_toolkits.basemap`.

2. Read HDF Data: 
   Access the dataset `RetrievedSurfaceTemperatureDay` from the group `/HDFEOS/GRIDS/MOP03/Data Fields` into a variable named `data`. 
   Extract attributes `long_name`, `units`, and `_FillValue`, decoding `long_name` and `units`.

3. Data Preprocessing:
   - Replace `_FillValue` with `NaN`.
   - Mask data using `numpy.ma.masked_array` where values are not `NaN`.

4. Geolocation Data: 
   Then it reads the geolocation data
   - `Latitude`, which contains latitude values, `Longitude`, which contains longitude values from the group `/HDFEOS/GRIDS/MOP03/Data Fields`
   Read latitude and longitude from respective datasets into variables `x` and `y`, then create a meshgrid.

5. Basemap Setup:
   - Use cylindrical projection with low resolution.
   - Set boundaries from -90 to 90 for latitude and -180 to 180 for longitude.
   - Add coastlines, parallels at intervals of 45 degrees from -90 to 90, and meridians similarly from -180 to 180, labeling the first and last ones such as [True, False, False, True].

6. Visualization: 
   - Use `plt.scatter` with parameters including data, colormap 'jet', no edge colors, and linewidth 0.
   - Add a colorbar labeled with the units attribute.

7. Cleanup: Include `plt.show()` or save the figure as needed.

Okay, so I need to break down this user's query into three specific sub-queries. Let me start by understanding what the user is asking for.

The main task is a Python script that processes and visualizes HDF data using certain libraries. The user has outlined several steps: importing libraries, reading HDF data, preprocessing it, handling geolocation data, setting up a basemap, visualizing, and cleanup.

First, I'll tackle the HDF5 Dataset Access part. The user wants to access a specific dataset from an HDF file. They mentioned using h5py, so I should focus on how to open the file, navigate to the correct group, read the dataset, and extract attributes like long_name, units, and _FillValue. Also, decoding these attributes is important.

Next, for NumPy-based Data Preprocessing, the user wants to replace the fill value with NaNs and mask the data where values are not NaN. I should think about using numpy functions like where or masked_array. Handling min and max might come into play here as well.

Then, the Map Plotting and Visualization part involves using Basemap from mpl_toolkits. The user specified a cylindrical projection, setting boundaries, adding coastlines, parallels, meridians, and creating a scatter plot with a colorbar. I need to focus on how to set up these elements correctly in the script.

I should ensure each sub-query is concise and targets only the specific technical domain so that relevant documentation can be retrieved easily.

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:  
How to access the dataset `RetrievedSurfaceTemperatureDay` from the group `/HDFEOS/GRIDS/MOP03/Data Fields` using `h5py`, extract its attributes `long_name`, `units`, and `_FillValue`, and decode the attribute strings.

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:  
How to replace the `_FillValue` with `NaN` in a NumPy array, create a masked array using `numpy.ma.masked_array` where values are not `NaN`, and apply preprocessing logic like filtering data based on `min` or `max`.

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:  
How to use `Basemap` from `mpl_toolkits.basemap` to create a cylindrical projection with low resolution, set boundaries for latitude (-90 to 90) and longitude (-180 to 180), add coastlines, parallels at 45-degree intervals, and meridians similarly, label the first and last ones, and visualize data using `plt.scatter` with colormap 'jet' and add a colorbar.
