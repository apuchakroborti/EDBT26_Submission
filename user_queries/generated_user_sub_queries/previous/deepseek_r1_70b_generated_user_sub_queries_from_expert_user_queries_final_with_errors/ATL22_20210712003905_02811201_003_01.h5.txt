"""
        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            1. Import Necessary Libraries:  
   Import the required libraries for handling operating system functions, creating visualizations, numerical computations, map projections, and working with HDF5 files: `os`, `matplotlib`, `matplotlib.pyplot`, `numpy`, and `mpl_toolkits.basemap`.

2. Define Constants:  
   Define a constant `FILE_NAME` with the value `'ATL22_20210712003905_02811201_003_01.h5'`, which specifies the HDF5 file to be processed.

3. Open the HDF5 File and Access Datasets:  
   Open the HDF5 file in read mode and access the following datasets:  
   - `transect_lat` for latitude data.  
   - `transect_lon` for longitude data.  
   - `inland_water_body_type` for the main data. from `gt1l` 

   Read the attributes `units`, `long_name` (decoded using `decode('ascii', 'replace')`), and `_FillValue` from the inland_water_body_type dataset.

4. Data Processing and Cleaning:  
   Convert the main data to a float type using `.astype(float)`. Replace the `_FillValue` with `numpy.NaN` and mask the data using `numpy.ma.masked_where(numpy.isnan(data), data)`.

5. Create a Map:  
   Create an equidistant cylindrical projection map with low resolution, setting latitude and longitude bounds from -90 to 90 and -180 to 180, respectively. 
   Add coastlines with a line width of 0.5, parallels at intervals of [-90, -60, -30, 0, 30, 60, 90], and meridians at intervals of [-180, -135, -90, -45, 0, 45, 90, 135, 180].

6. Scatter Plot:  
   Use the `scatter` function to plot the data on the map with parameters: longitude, latitude, `c=data`, marker size `s=0.1`, colormap `plt.cm.jet`, and no edge colors or linewidth.

7. Add Colorbar and Title:  
   Add a colorbar to the map, positioned at the bottom, labeled with the main dataset's `units`. 
   Set the title of the plot to include the file basename, dataset path name, and `long_name` from the attributes.

Okay, so I need to break down this user query into three specific sub-queries. Let me read through the original query again to understand what each part is asking for.

The first part of the user's task is about importing libraries like os, matplotlib, numpy, and mpl_toolkits.basemap, but that's not directly related to the sub-queries they want. The main focus is on accessing HDF5 files, preprocessing data with NumPy, and visualizing the data on a map.

Starting with the first sub-query: HDF5 Dataset Access. The user wants to open an HDF5 file and access specific datasets like transect_lat, transect_lon, and inland_water_body_type from the group gt1l. They also need to read attributes such as units, long_name (decoded), and _FillValue.

Next, for NumPy-based Data Preprocessing: The user is converting data to float, replacing _FillValue with NaN, and masking using numpy.ma.masked_where. I should focus on how to handle these steps, possibly including examples of using np.where or other methods.

Lastly, the Map Plotting sub-query involves creating a map with specific projections, adding coastlines, meridians, parallels, and then plotting the data as a scatter plot. They also want a colorbar and title based on the HDF5 attributes.

I need to make sure each sub-query is concise and targets only the specified technical domains so that relevant documentation can be retrieved easily.

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:  
How to open an HDF5 file in read mode using `h5py` and access datasets such as `transect_lat`, `transect_lon`, and `inland_water_body_type` from group `gt1l`. Also, how to read attributes like `units`, `long_name` (with decoding), and `_FillValue`.

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:  
How to convert data to float type using `.astype(float)`, replace `_FillValue` with `numpy.NaN`, and mask data using `numpy.ma.masked_where(numpy.isnan(data), data)`.

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:  
How to create an equidistant cylindrical projection map with low resolution, set latitude and longitude bounds, add coastlines, parallels, and meridians. Also, how to plot a scatter plot on the map with specified parameters and add a colorbar and title based on HDF5 attributes.
