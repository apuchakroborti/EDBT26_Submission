"""
        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            1. Import Necessary Libraries:  
   Import the required libraries for handling OS functions, creating visualizations, numerical computations, map projections, and HDF5 files: `os`, `matplotlib`, `matplotlib.pyplot`, `numpy`, and `mpl_toolkits.basemap`.

2. Define Constants:  
   Set a constant `FILE_NAME` to the path of the HDF5 file: `ATL17_20201201000814_10360901_005_01.h5`.

3. Open HDF5 File and Access Datasets:  
   Open the HDF5 file in read mode and access three datasets: `/global_grid_lat` (latitude data), `/global_grid_lon` (longitude data), and `/global_asr` (main data).

4. Read Dataset Attributes:  
   Extract attributes `units` and `long_name` from the global_asr dataset using `decode('ascii', 'replace')`. Also, retrieve the `_FillValue` attribute.

5. Data Processing and Cleaning:  
   - Convert the global_asr dataset's `_FillValue` to `numpy NaN`.
   - Mask the data using `numpy.ma.masked_where` with conditions `numpy.isnan(data)` and `data`.

6. Create Map Projection:  
   Use a cylindrical projection map with low resolution, setting latitude bounds from -90 to 90 and longitude bounds from -180 to 180.

7. Customize Map Features:  
   - Add coastlines with a line width of 0.5.
   - Draw parallels at intervals of [-90, -60, -30, 0, 30, 60, 90] using `numpy.arange`.
   - Draw meridians at intervals of [-180, -135, -90, -45, 0, 45, 90, 135, 180] using `numpy.arange`.

8. Adjust Longitude Values:  
   Subtract 180 from longitude values before plotting to ensure correct map projection.

9. Plot Data on Map:  
   Use `pcolormesh` to plot the data with parameters: longitude, latitude, data, and `latlon=True`.

10. Add Colorbar and Title:  
    - Add a colorbar to the map, positioned at the bottom, labeled with the global_asr dataset's units.
    - Set the title of the map to include the file basename and the `long_name` attribute from the dataset.

Okay, so I'm trying to break down this user's query into three focused sub-queries. Let me start by understanding what each part of their original query is asking for.

First, the user wants to import several libraries: os, matplotlib, its pyplot submodule, numpy, and mpl_toolkits.basemap. But since my task is to create sub-queries, I don't need to write code here. Instead, I should focus on what each part of their process involves technically.

Looking at step 3, they're opening an HDF5 file and accessing specific datasets: global_grid_lat, global_grid_lon, and global_asr. So the first sub-query should be about using h5py to access these datasets by their paths.

Next, in step 4, they extract attributes like units and long_name from the dataset, decoding them from ASCII. They also retrieve _FillValue. This is still within HDF5 access, so it's part of the same sub-query.

Moving on to data processing: steps 5 involve converting _FillValue to NaN and masking using numpy functions. So the second sub-query should focus on handling these fill values and applying masks with NumPy.

For visualization, they set up a cylindrical projection map with specific bounds, add coastlines, draw parallels and meridians at certain intervals, adjust longitude values by subtracting 180, plot data with pcolormesh, and add a colorbar and title. This all falls under the third sub-query using matplotlib and basemap.

I need to make sure each sub-query is concise and targets only the specific technical domain without mixing them up. So I'll structure each part clearly, ensuring they cover exactly what's needed for HDF5 access, NumPy processing, and plotting respectively.

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:  
How to convert the `_FillValue` of a dataset to `numpy NaN` and mask data using `numpy.ma.masked_where` with conditions such as `numpy.isnan(data)` and other preprocessing logic.
