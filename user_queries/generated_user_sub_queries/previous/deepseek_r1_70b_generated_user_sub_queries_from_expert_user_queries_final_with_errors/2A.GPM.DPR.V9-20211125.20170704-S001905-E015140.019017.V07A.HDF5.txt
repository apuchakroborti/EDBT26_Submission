        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            A script to visualize precipitation rate data from an HDF5 file by following these steps:

1. Import Libraries: Use os, matplotlib, matplotlib.pyplot, numpy, mpl_toolkits.basemap, and h5py.

2. Open HDF5 File: Access the file in read-only mode and extract the `precipRateESurface` dataset along with its units and _FillValue attribute.

3. Handle Missing Data: Replace _FillValue entries with NaNs using numpy's masked_where function to mask the data where values are NaN.

4. Retrieve Geolocation Data: Extract latitude from `Latitude` and longitude from `Longitude`.

5. Set Up Map Projection: Create a cylindrical projection with low resolution, spanning latitudes from -90 to 90 and longitudes from -180 to 180.

6. Customize Map: Add coastlines (width 0.5), parallels at [-90, -45, 0, 45, 90], and meridians at [-180, -135, -90, -45, 0, 45, 90, 135, 180] with labels [True, False, False, True] with specific labels.

7. Plot Data: Use a scatter plot with the 'jet' colormap, point size of 1, based on longitude and latitude coordinates.

8. Add Colorbar and Title: Include a colorbar below the plot, labeled with the dataset's units, and set the title to reflect the file and dataset name.

Okay, so I need to break down this user query into three specific sub-queries. Let me read through the problem again.

The user wants a script that visualizes precipitation rate data from an HDF5 file. They've outlined eight steps, starting with importing libraries and ending with adding a colorbar and title. My task is to split this into three focused areas: HDF5 access, NumPy preprocessing, and map plotting.

First, for the HDF5 part, I need to focus on accessing the file using h5py. The user mentioned specific file extensions like H5, h5, etc., so I should include those. They also want to extract a dataset called 'precipRateESurface' along with its units and _FillValue attribute. So my sub-query here should cover opening the file in read-only mode, accessing that particular dataset, and retrieving both the data and its metadata.

Next, the NumPy preprocessing step involves handling missing data. The user wants to replace _FillValue entries with NaNs using numpy's masked_where function. I need to make sure this sub-query specifically addresses how to apply masks where values are NaN, possibly using np.where or other functions for filtering based on min, max, etc.

Lastly, the plotting part uses matplotlib and basemap. The user wants a cylindrical projection with certain lat-lon spans, coastlines, parallels, meridians, labels, and a scatter plot. I should structure this sub-query to cover setting up the map projection, adding geographical features, and plotting the data points with specified parameters.

I need to ensure each sub-query is concise and targets only its specific domain without overlapping into others. Also, they must be clear so that someone can retrieve relevant documentation or examples from a vector database based on these queries.
