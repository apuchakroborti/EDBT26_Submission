        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            1. Import Libraries: Import necessary libraries including os, matplotlib, matplotlib.pyplot, numpy, and mpl_toolkits.basemap for handling OS functions, plotting, numerical operations, map projections, and HDF5 files.

2. Define Constants: Set the constant `FILE_NAME` to "ATL19_20181001010615_00370101_003_02.h5".

3. Read HDF5 File: Open the HDF5 file in read mode and access datasets at paths `latitude`, `longitude`, and `beam_1/dot_avg` from `mid_latitude`.

4. Extract Attributes: For each dataset, read attributes `units` and `long_name` using decode('ascii', 'replace') and retrieve `_FillValue` from the main data.

5. Data Processing:
   - Convert main data to float type.
   - Replace `_FillValue` with numpy NaN.
   - Mask data where values are NaN using numpy masked_where.

6. Create Map: Initialize a cylindrical projection map with low resolution, setting latitude and longitude ranges from -90 to 90 and -180 to 180 respectively.

7. Add Map Features:
   - Draw coastlines with a line width of 0.5.
   - Add parallels at latitudes [-90, -60, -30, 0, 30, 60, 90, 120] and meridians at longitudes [-180, -135, -90, -45, 0, 45, 90, 135, 180].

8. Adjust Longitude: Before setting pcolormesh the 180 should be subtractted from longitude value and update the longitude existing value 
   Then it adds pcolormesh with parameters longitude, latitude, data, and latlon=True

9. Add Colorbar and Title:
    - Attach a colorbar at the bottom of the map, labeled with the dataset's units.
    - Set the title using the file basename and `long_name` attribute from the dot_avg dataset.

        ---
        Note: return only the the response of sub-queries only based on the below format, not explanation, not python code, and node additional text needed
        Return format:

        HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
        <generated sub-query>

        NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:

        Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:

Okay, so I'm trying to break down this user's query into three focused sub-queries. Let me start by understanding what each part of their task entails.

First, the user is working with an HDF5 file using h5py. They need to access specific datasets like latitude, longitude, and beam_1/dot_avg from mid_latitude. Also, they want to extract attributes such as units and long_name, and handle _FillValue. So for the first sub-query, I should focus on how to use h5py to open the file, navigate to these paths, read datasets and their attributes.

Next, the data processing part involves converting data to float, replacing _FillValue with NaNs, and masking using NumPy functions like np.where or np.ma.masked_where. The sub-query here should target NumPy methods for handling missing values and preprocessing data efficiently.

Lastly, the visualization step uses matplotlib and basemap to create a map with specific projections, coastlines, meridians, parallels, and then plot the data. I need to frame this as a question about using these libraries to set up the map correctly and display the data with appropriate colorbars and titles.

I should make sure each sub-query is clear and targets only the relevant technical areas so that the user can find specific documentation or examples for each part.

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:  
How do I use `h5py` to open an HDF5 file named "ATL19_20181001010615_00370101_003_02.h5" and access datasets at paths `/mid_latitude/latitude`, `/mid_latitude/longitude`, and `/mid_latitude/beam_1/dot_avg`? Additionally, how do I extract the `units` and `long_name` attributes from these datasets and retrieve the `_FillValue`?

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:  
What is the correct way to convert HDF5 data to float type, replace `_FillValue` with NumPy NaNs, and mask NaN values using `np.ma.masked_where` or similar functions?

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:  
How can I use `matplotlib` and `mpl_toolkits.basemap` to create a cylindrical projection map with low resolution, draw coastlines, add specific parallels and meridians, adjust longitude values by subtracting 180, and plot the data using `pcolormesh` with latlon=True? Additionally, how do I add a colorbar labeled with dataset units and set the title using the file basename and dataset long_name?
