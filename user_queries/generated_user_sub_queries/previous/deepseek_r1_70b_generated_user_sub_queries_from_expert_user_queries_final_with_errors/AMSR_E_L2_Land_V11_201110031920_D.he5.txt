        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            A Python script that reads an HDF5 file and generates a map visualization by following these steps:

1. Import Libraries: Include os, matplotlib, matplotlib.pyplot, numpy, mpl_toolkits.basemap, and h5py.

2. Read HDF5 File: Open the file `AMSR_E_L2_Land_V11_201110031920_D.he5` in read-only mode.

3. Extract Data:
   - Retrieve main data from the attribute 'SoilMoistureSCA' at `AMSR-E Level 2 Land Data/Data/Combined NPD and SCA Output Fields`.
   - Extract latitude data from `/HDFEOS/POINTS/AMSR-E Level 2 Land Data/Data/Combined NPD and SCA Output Fields/Latitude`.
   - Extract longitude data from `/HDFEOS/POINTS/AMSR-E Level 2 Land Data/Data/Combined NPD and SCA Output Fields/Longitude`.

4. Data Cleaning:
   - Assign a static _FillValue of -9999.0.
   - Replace values matching _FillValue with numpy NaN.
   - Mask data using numpy's masked_array where values are not NaN.

5. Create Map:
   - Use an equidistant cylindrical projection with low resolution.
   - Set latitude range from -90 to 90 and longitude from -170 to 190.
   - Add coastlines with a linewidth of 0.5.
   - Draw parallels using numpy arrange with values -90, 91, 45 and labels [1, 0, 0, 0].
   - Draw meridians using numpy arrange with values -180, 181, 45 and labels [0, 0, 0, 1].

6. Scatter Plot:
   - Use longitude and latitude data.
   - Set parameters: marker size (s=0.1), colormap (plt.cm.jet), edgecolors=None, linewidth=0.

7. Add Colorbar and Title:
   - Include a colorbar labeled with the dataset's units.
   - Set title to include the file basename and 'SoilMoistureSCA'.

Okay, so I need to break down this user's query into three specific sub-queries. Let me start by understanding what the user is asking for.

The user provided a Python script outline that reads an HDF5 file and creates a map visualization. They want me to split this task into three focused areas: accessing the HDF5 data, preprocessing with NumPy, and plotting with mapping tools.

First, looking at the HDF5 part. The user's script uses h5py to open a .he5 file. They access specific datasets like 'SoilMoistureSCA' and latitude/longitude from certain paths. So the sub-query should focus on using h5py for these accesses, including handling paths and attributes.

Next, data preprocessing with NumPy. The user assigns a _FillValue, replaces values with NaN, and masks data. I need to frame this as a sub-query about handling fill values and masking using NumPy functions like np.where or masked arrays.

Lastly, the visualization part uses matplotlib and basemap. They set up a projection, draw coastlines, meridians, parallels, and add colorbars and titles. The sub-query should target how to use these libraries for map plotting with specific configurations.

I need to ensure each sub-query is concise and targets only the relevant technical domain so that documentation can be retrieved effectively.
