        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            1. File Input and Constants
   - Specify the input file `MOP02N-20180311-L2V19.9.2.he5` stored in the constant `FILE_NAME`.
   - Import necessary libraries: `os`, `datetime`, `h5py`, `numpy` as `np`, `matplotlib` as `mpl`, `matplotlib.pyplot` as `plt`, and `mpl_toolkits.basemap.Basemap`.

2. Extracting Data
   - Extract data from the HDF5 dataset at `/HDFEOS/SWATHS/MOP02/Data Fields/RetrievedCOTotalColumn`.
   - Read the contents into an array called `data`, taking only the first column.
   - Retrieve the `units` and `_FillValue` attributes associated with this dataset.
   - Replace the `_FillValue` in the `RetrievedCOTotalColumn` data with `numpy.nan`.

3. Extracting Geolocation Data
   - Extract latitude values from `Latitude`, longitude values from `Longitude` from the group `/HDFEOS/SWATHS/MOP02/Geolocation Fields`

4. Creating a Map
   - Add coastlines with a line width of 0.5.
   - Draw parallels using `numpy.arange(-90, 91, 45)`.
   - Draw meridians using `numpy.arange(-180, 181, 45)` and set labels to `[True, False, False, True]`.

5. Scatter Plot
   - Create a scatter plot with parameters: longitude, latitude, data array `c=data`, marker size `s=1`, colormap `plt.cm.jet`, no edge colors (`edgecolors=None`), and line width `linewidth=0`.

6. Customizing the Map
   - Add a colorbar to represent the units of the data.
   - Set the colorbar label using the `units` attribute from the dataset.

        Note: return only the the response of sub-queries only based on the below format, not explanation, not python code, and node additional text needed
        Return format:

<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to break down this user's query into three focused sub-queries. Let me start by understanding what each part of their original task entails.

First, the user is working with an HDF5 file, specifically using h5py. They need to access datasets and attributes, handle dataset paths like '/HDFEOS/SWATHS/MOP02/Data Fields/RetrievedCOTotalColumn', and manage metadata such as units and _FillValue. So for the first sub-query, I should focus on how to use h5py to open the file, navigate to the correct path, read the data, and extract attributes.

Next, they're dealing with NumPy for preprocessing. They have to replace _FillValue with NaNs, which can be done using np.where or masked arrays. Also, any filtering based on min, max, etc., would fall here. So the second sub-query should cover these operations, ensuring that the data is properly cleaned and prepared for analysis.

Lastly, visualization using Basemap or Cartopy. They want to create a map with coastlines, specific parallels and meridians, and a scatter plot of their data. Adding a colorbar with the correct units is also important. So the third sub-query should focus on setting up the map projection, drawing the required elements, creating the scatter plot, and customizing the colorbar.

I need to make sure each sub-query is concise and targets only the specific technical domain without overlapping. That way, when someone looks for documentation or examples, they can find exactly what they need.
