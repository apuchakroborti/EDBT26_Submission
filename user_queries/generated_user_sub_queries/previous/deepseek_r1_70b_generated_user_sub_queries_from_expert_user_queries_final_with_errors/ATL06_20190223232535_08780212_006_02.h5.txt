        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            1. Import Libraries: Include necessary modules for OS operations, plotting, numerical computations, map projections, and HDF5 handling.

2. Define Constants: Set `FILE_NAME` to "ATL06_20190223232535_08780212_006_02.h5".

3. Read HDF5 Data: Open the file in read mode and extract datasets for 
    `latitude` latitude data, `longitude` longitude data, and `h_li` main data from /gt1l/land_ice_segments  
Retrieve attributes using decode() and handle _FillValue.

4. Preprocess Data: Replace _FillValue in h_li with NaNs and mask invalid data using numpy functions.

5. Create Map: Using an equidistant cylindrical projection map 
with low resolution and latitude and longitude values from -90 to 90 and -180 to 180 respectively. 
It also adds coastlines with linewidth of 0.5, 
parallels with parameters of nummpy arrange with values -90, 120, 30, 
and meridians with parameters numpy arrange -180, 180, 45

6. Plot Data: 
The program should set scatter function with parameters of longitude, latitude, c=data, s=0.1, cmap=plt.cm.jet, edgecolors=None, and linewidth=0
Generate a scatter plot of the data with given parameters including colormap and marker size.

7. Add Colorbar and Title: Include a colorbar labeled with dataset units and set the title using the file's basename and long_name.

<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help the user break down their data science task into smaller parts. They have a query that involves several steps with HDF5 files, data preprocessing, and visualization. My job is to split this into three focused sub-queries.

First, looking at step 3 of the user's query: they need to read specific datasets from an HDF5 file using h5py. They mentioned accessing latitude, longitude, and h_li from /gt1l/land_ice_segments. Also, handling attributes with decode() and dealing with _FillValue is important here.

Next, step 4 involves preprocessing the data. The user wants to replace _FillValue in h_li with NaNs and mask invalid data using NumPy functions like np.where or np.ma.masked_where. So I need to focus on how to apply these methods correctly.

Then, steps 5 and 6 are about creating a map and plotting. They specified using an equidistant cylindrical projection with certain parameters for coastlines, parallels, and meridians. For plotting, they want a scatter plot with specific markers and colormap settings. I should make sure the sub-query covers these visualization aspects using matplotlib or cartopy.

I need to ensure each sub-query is clear and targets only one technical domain so that relevant resources can be found easily.

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:  
How to access HDF5 datasets such as `latitude`, `longitude`, and `h_li` from the path `/gt1l/land_ice_segments` using `h5py`. Also, how to retrieve attributes and handle `_FillValue`.

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:  
Methods to replace `_FillValue` with NaNs in NumPy arrays and mask invalid data using functions like `np.where` or `np.ma.masked_where`.

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:  
How to create a map with equidistant cylindrical projection, add coastlines, parallels at [-90, 120, 30], and meridians at [-180, 180, 45] using `cartopy`. Also, how to plot scatter data with specified parameters including colormap and marker size.
