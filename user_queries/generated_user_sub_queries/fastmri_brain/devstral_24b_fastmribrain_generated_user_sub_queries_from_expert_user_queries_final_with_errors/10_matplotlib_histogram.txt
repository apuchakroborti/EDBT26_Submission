"""
        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            It starts by importing necessary libraries and defining file paths. 

The code then defines two file paths: one for an HDF5 which is located at 10_fastMRI_brain_first_10_dcm_to_h5.h5 file containing brain MRI data 
and another for a specific dataset within the HDF5 file. 
It opens the HDF5 file in read mode and accesses the dataset at the specified path, assigning it to `brain_vol`. 
The shape of the original 2D dataset is printed.

Next, the code reshapes the 2D dataset into a 3D array with dimensions (16, 32, 512) representing 16 slices, each with 32 rows and 512 columns. 
It then computes a histogram of the brain volume data.

From a high-level perspective, this program appears to be part of a medical imaging pipeline that processes MRI data from the NYU fastMRI dataset.

The HDF5 file contains a hierarchy of groups and datasets. 
In this case, the `FAST_MRI_BRAIN_H5_FILE_DATA_PATH` variable specifies the path to a dataset within the HDF5 file, 
which is: `FAST_MRI_BRAIN_ROOT` -> `100099070170` -> `279` -> `fastMRI_brain_data`. This hierarchy allows the program to access specific datasets within the HDF5 file."

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
How to open an HDF5 file with `h5py` in read mode, access a dataset at a specific path like `/FAST_MRI_BRAIN_ROOT/100099070170/279/fastMRI_brain_data`, and print the shape of the dataset.

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
How to reshape a 2D NumPy array into a 3D array with dimensions (16, 32, 512) and compute a histogram of the data using NumPy functions.

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
