"""
        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            The code starts by defining file paths and variables. 
It imports necessary libraries and defines two file paths: `FAST_MRI_BRAIN_H5_FILE` which is located at 7_fastMRI_brain_first_10_dcm_to_h5.h5 for an HDF5 file containing brain MRI data, 
and `FAST_MRI_BRAIN_H5_FILE_DATA_PATH` for the path within the HDF5 file where the brain MRI data is stored.

The code reads the HDF5 file, assigning it to a variable `f`. Within the `with` block, 
it reads the brain MRI data from the HDF5 file using the defined `FAST_MRI_BRAIN_H5_FILE_DATA_PATH`, 
which is stored within a group named FAST_MRI_BRAIN_ROOT --> /100099070170 --> /279 --> where the dataset is fastMRI_brain_data 
The data is assigned to a variable `brain_vol`.

The code then reshapes the 2D dataset into a 3D array with shape `(16, 32, 512)`, representing 16 slices, each with 32 rows and 512 columns. 
It applies a Gaussian filter to the 3D brain volume data using a sigma value of 4 to reduce noise in the image.

The code prepares to plot slices of the smoothed using gaussian_filter of sigma value 4 of brain volume data by defining variables for the subplot grid, number of subplots, 
number of slices, step size, and range of slices to plot. It creates a figure with subplots and iterates over the slices, plotting each one as a grayscale image.

Set the fig_rows and fig_cols to 4, then calculate the n_subplots by multiplying fig_rows and fig_cols, calculates step_size dividing n_slice by n_subplots,
then calculates plot_range by multiplying n_subplots and step_size, then it calculates start_stop from the difference of n_slice and plot_range and divides by 2
The program creates a figure with multiple subplots by using a loop by enumerating from the range of start_stop to plot_range by increasing by step_size,
set imshow by slicing data from the x axis,  

Finally, the code adjusts the layout so that the plots fit nicely in the figure.

        Return format:

 HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
```python
import h5py

# Open the file
with h5py.File(FAST_MRI_BRAIN_H5_FILE, 'r') as f:
    # Read data from the defined path
    brain_vol = f[FAST_MRI_BRAIN_H5_FILE_DATA_PATH][()]
```

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
```python
import numpy as np

# Apply a Gaussian filter to the data
brain_vol_filtered = np.array([np.where(val != _FillValue, val, np.nan) for val in brain_vol])

# Compute or filter data using min and max
min_val = np.nanmin(brain_vol_filtered)
max_val = np.nanmax(brain_vol_filtered)
```

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from mpl_toolkits.basemap import Basemap

# Create a figure with subplots
fig, axs = plt.subplots(4, 4)

# Iterate over the slices and plot each one
for i in range(start_stop, plot_range, step_size):
    m = Basemap(projection='ortho', lat_0=35, lon_0=-100)
    m.drawcoastlines()
    m.drawcountries()
    m.drawmapboundary(fill_color='#99ffff')
    im = m.imshow(brain_vol[i], cmap=plt.cm.jet, interpolation='nearest')
    plt.title('Slice {}'.format(i))
```

Note: The above sub-queries are simplified and may need to be adjusted based on the specific requirements of your task. Also, please ensure that you have installed necessary libraries (like h5py, numpy, matplotlib) before running these sub-queries.
