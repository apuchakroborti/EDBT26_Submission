"""
        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            This program reads MRI brain data from an HDF5 file, prints information about the data, and visualizes it using Matplotlib.

Defining File Paths
Two file paths are defined: `FAST_MRI_BRAIN_H5_FILE` which reads data from the location 0_fastMRI_brain_first_10_dcm_to_h5.h5 (the path to the HDF5 file) 
and `FAST_MRI_BRAIN_H5_FILE_DATA_PATH` (the path within the HDF5 file to a specific dataset) which read from FAST_MRI_BRAIN_ROOT root group, 
sub group is 100099070170/279 and dataset is fastMRI_brain_data.

Reading Data from HDF5 File
The program opens the HDF5 file in read-only mode. It accesses the dataset at the specified path and reads its contents into a NumPy array called `brain_slice`.

Printing Information about the Data
The program prints:
The type of the `brain_slice` object (a NumPy array)
The shape of the `brain_slice` array (its dimensions)

Plotting the Data:
The program creates a figure with using Matplotlib. It displays the `brain_slice` data as an image, and applies a gray colormap to enhance feature visibility.

 HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
```python
import h5py

# Open the file in read mode
with h5py.File(FAST_MRI_BRAIN_H5_FILE, 'r') as f:
    # Access the dataset at the specified path
    brain_slice = f[FAST_MRI_BRAIN_H5_FILE_DATA_PATH][()]
```

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
```python
import numpy as np

# Apply masks using NumPy functions
masked_brain_slice = np.ma.masked_where(brain_slice == _FillValue, brain_slice)

# Compute or filter data
min_value = np.min(masked_brain_slice)
max_value = np.max(masked_brain_slice)
filtered_data = np.where((brain_slice >= min_value) & (brain_slice <= max_value), brain_slice, 0)

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create a figure with using Matplotlib
fig = plt.figure(figsize=(12, 8))

# Configure the map
map = Basemap(projection='ortho', lat_0=45, lon_0=-100)

# Draw coastlines, meridians and parallels
map.drawcoastlines()
map.drawmeridians(np.arange(-180., 181., 30.))
map.drawparallels(np.arange(-90., 91., 30.))

# Apply a gray colormap to enhance feature visibility
plt.imshow(filtered_data, cmap='gray')

# Add colorbar and title
cbar = plt.colorbar()
cbar.set_label('Intensity')
plt.title('MRI Brain Data Visualization')

# Display the figure
plt.show()
