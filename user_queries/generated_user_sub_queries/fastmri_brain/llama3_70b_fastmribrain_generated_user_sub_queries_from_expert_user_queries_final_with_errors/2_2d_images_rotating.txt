"""
        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            A Python code that works with MRI brain data stored in an HDF5 file. Here's what I've gathered so far:

The code starts by defining two important file paths: 
`FAST_MRI_BRAIN_H5_FILE` which is located at 2_fastMRI_brain_first_10_dcm_to_h5.h5 and `FAST_MRI_BRAIN_H5_FILE_DATA_PATH` whole path is 

root group is FAST_MRI_BRAIN_ROOT parent sub group is 279 and dataset is fastMRI_brain_data. The latter is a path within the HDF5 file to access the brain data.

Next, it reads data from the HDF5 file. Specifically, it extracts two datasets: `brain_2D_data` (a 2D slice of brain data). 
Both are read into memory using slicing notation.

The code then prints information about these datasets, including their contents, types, and shapes.

After that, it rotates the brain images for better visualization. 
For instance, a 2D slice of both rows and columns from 10 to 502 of the brain data is rotated by 270 degrees counter-clockwise and displayed with a bone colormap. 
The axis labels are turned off, and the resulting plot is displayed.

The code repeats this process for the coronal plane.

Overall, it seems like this program is designed for visualizing and exploring MRI brain data stored in an HDF5 file. 
It extracts specific datasets from the file, rotates them for better visualization, and displays them using Matplotlib.
