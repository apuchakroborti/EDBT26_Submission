"""
        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            The code starts by defining two constants: `FAST_MRI_BRAIN_H5_FILE` (the path to the HDF5 file) which is located at 1_fastMRI_brain_first_10_dcm_to_h5.h5 
and `FAST_MRI_BRAIN_H5_FILE_DATA_PATH` (the path within the HDF5 file where the brain volume data is stored) which is located below:
`FAST_MRI_BRAIN_ROOT/100099070170/279/fastMRI_brain_data`

It then opens the HDF5 file in read mode, accessing the brain volume data by navigating to the specified path FAST_MRI_BRAIN_H5_FILE_DATA_PATH. 
It reads all data along all axes, storing it in the `brain_vol` variable.

The code prints information about the `brain_vol` data and visualizes a slice through different planes of the brain volume data using image plots. 
Specifically, it creates plots of bone map (a slice from 10 to 502 from both the rows and columns) , using indexing to select specific slices from the 2D array.

        Note: return only the the response of sub-queries only based on the below format, not explanation, not python code, and node additional text needed

        """

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
Accessing HDF5 file with h5py, navigating to dataset path FAST_MRI_BRAIN_ROOT/100099070170/279/fastMRI_brain_data, reading data along all axes.

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
Handling _FillValue in brain volume data, applying masks using np.where or np.ma.masked_where, computing or filtering data using min, max, or other preprocessing logic.

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
Visualizing 2D slices of brain volume data using matplotlib, configuring image plots with specific rows and columns (e.g., 10 to 502), adding titles and colorbars.
