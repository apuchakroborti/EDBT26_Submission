"""
        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            A Python code that works with MRI brain data stored in an HDF5 file. Here's what I've gathered so far:

The code starts by defining two important file paths: 
`FAST_MRI_BRAIN_H5_FILE` which is located at 2_fastMRI_brain_first_10_dcm_to_h5.h5 and `FAST_MRI_BRAIN_H5_FILE_DATA_PATH` whole path is located below:
`FAST_MRI_BRAIN_ROOT/100099070170/279/fastMRI_brain_data`

Next, it reads data from the HDF5 file. Specifically, it extracts two datasets: `brain_2D_data` (a 2D slice of brain data). 
Both are read into memory using slicing notation.

The code then prints information about these datasets, including their contents, types, and shapes.

After that, it rotates the brain images for better visualization. 
For instance, a 2D slice of both rows and columns from 10 to 502 of the brain data is rotated by 270 degrees counter-clockwise using scipy.ndimage and displayed with a bone colormap. 
The axis labels are turned off, and the resulting plot is displayed. The code repeats this process for the coronal plane.

        Note: return only the the response of sub-queries only based on the below format, not explanation, not python code, and node additional text needed
        Return format:

        HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
        <generated sub-query>

        NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
        <generated sub-query>

        Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
        <generated sub-query>
        """

Here are the 3 sub-queries:

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
Accessing HDF5 file with h5py, reading datasets brain_2D_data from path FAST_MRI_BRAIN_ROOT/100099070170/279/fastMRI_brain_data.

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
Handling _FillValue in NumPy arrays, applying masks using np.where and np.ma.masked_where, rotating 2D slice of brain data by 270 degrees counter-clockwise using scipy.ndimage.

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
Visualizing 2D slice of brain data with matplotlib or cartopy, configuring axis labels, displaying plot with bone colormap.
