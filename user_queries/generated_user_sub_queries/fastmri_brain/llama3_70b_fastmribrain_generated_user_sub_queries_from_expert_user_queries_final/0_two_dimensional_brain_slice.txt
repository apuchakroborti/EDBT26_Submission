"""
        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            This program reads MRI brain data from an HDF5 file, prints information about the data, and visualizes it using Matplotlib.

Defining File Paths
Two file paths are defined: `FAST_MRI_BRAIN_H5_FILE` which reads data from the location 0_fastMRI_brain_first_10_dcm_to_h5.h5 (the path to the HDF5 file) 
and `FAST_MRI_BRAIN_H5_FILE_DATA_PATH` (the path within the HDF5 file to a specific dataset) which is located below: 
`FAST_MRI_BRAIN_ROOT/100099070170/279/fastMRI_brain_data`

Reading Data from HDF5 File
The program opens the HDF5 file in read-only mode. 
It accesses the dataset at the specified path and reads its contents into a NumPy array called `brain_slice`.

Printing Information about the Data
The program prints:
The type of the `brain_slice` object (a NumPy array)
The shape of the `brain_slice` array (its dimensions)

Plotting the Data:
The program creates a figure with using Matplotlib. It displays the `brain_slice` data as an image, and applies a gray colormap to enhance feature visibility.

        Note: return only the the response of sub-queries only based on the below format, not explanation, not python code, and node additional text needed
        Return format:

        """

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
Accessing HDF5 file with h5py, reading dataset at path /FAST_MRI_BRAIN_ROOT/100099070170/279/fastMRI_brain_data, retrieving metadata.

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
Handling _FillValue in NumPy array brain_slice, applying masks using np.where or np.ma.masked_where, computing min and max values for data preprocessing.

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
Visualizing 2D image data with Matplotlib, configuring gray colormap, displaying image with axis labels and title.
