"""
        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            Loading Data
The code loads an HDF5 file located at `9_fastMRI_brain_first_10_dcm_to_h5.h5`. 
This file is opened in read-only mode.

Accessing Data
The script accesses a specific dataset within the HDF5 file, located at `FAST_MRI_BRAIN_ROOT/100099070170/279/fastMRI_brain_data`, which represents brain MRI data. 
This dataset is assigned to the variable `brain_vol`.

Reshaping Data
The 2D dataset `brain_vol` is reshaped into a 3D array with dimensions `(16, 32, 512)`, representing a volume of brain MRI data.

Smoothing Data
A Gaussian filter from scipy.ndimage is applied to the reshaped 3D dataset `brain_vol` to reduce noise and make it suitable for segmentation.

Plotting Smoothed Images
A subset of smoothed images from the 3D volume is plotted, displaying every 4th slice starting from the middle of the volume. Each image is displayed in grayscale.

Segmenting Smoothed Images
The smoothed images are segmented by applying another Gaussian filter and plotting the histogram of filtered values. 
Based on the histogram, a range of bins for grey matter (16-25) is selected and a mask for the brain region is created.

Plotting Brain Mask
Finally, the brain mask is plotted, displaying a 2D slice of the mask in grayscale with the axis turned off to focus on the brain region.
The code appears to be focused on processing and analyzing MRI data from the FAST_MRI_BRAIN dataset, specifically segmenting brain regions from smoothed images.

        Note: return only the the response of sub-queries only based on the below format, not explanation, not python code, and node additional text needed
        Return format:

        """

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
How to open an HDF5 file using `h5py` in read-only mode and access a dataset specified by a path like `FAST_MRI_BRAIN_ROOT/100099070170/279/fastMRI_brain_data`.

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
How to reshape a 2D NumPy array into a 3D array with specific dimensions (e.g., `(16, 32, 512)`), and how to apply a Gaussian filter using `scipy.ndimage` to a 3D NumPy array.

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
How to display 2D slices of a 3D NumPy array using `matplotlib`, configure the plot to show grayscale images, and turn off the axes for a cleaner visualization.
