"""
        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            The code starts by defining two constants: `FAST_MRI_BRAIN_H5_FILE` (the path to the HDF5 file) which is located at 1_fastMRI_brain_first_10_dcm_to_h5.h5 
and `FAST_MRI_BRAIN_H5_FILE_DATA_PATH` (the path within the HDF5 file where the brain volume data is stored) which is located below:
`FAST_MRI_BRAIN_ROOT/100099070170/279/fastMRI_brain_data`

It then opens the HDF5 file in read mode, accessing the brain volume data by navigating to the specified path FAST_MRI_BRAIN_H5_FILE_DATA_PATH. 
It reads all data along all axes, storing it in the `brain_vol` variable.

The code prints information about the `brain_vol` data and visualizes a slice through different planes of the brain volume data using image plots. 
Specifically, it creates plots of bone map (a slice from 10 to 502 from both the rows and columns) , using indexing to select specific slices from the 2D array.

        Note: return only the the response of sub-queries only based on the below format, not explanation, not python code, and node additional text needed

<think>
Okay, I need to break down the user's query into three specific sub-queries based on the given categories. Let me start by understanding each part of the user's problem.

First, the user is working with an HDF5 file located at a specific path and accessing data within it using another path. So for the HDF5 Dataset Access sub-query, I should focus on how to open the file, navigate to the correct dataset path, and read all the data into a variable. That makes sense because h5py is used for handling HDF5 files.

Next, the user mentions that they print information about the brain_vol data. This likely involves checking the shape, dtype, and min/max values. For the NumPy-based Data Preprocessing sub-query, I should include how to extract this information using NumPy functions like np.shape, np.min, and np.max. Also, since there's a mention of a bone map slice with specific indices, applying a mask or handling any fill values might be necessary here.

Lastly, the visualization part involves plotting slices from the brain volume data. The user specifies creating image plots for different planes, including setting titles, colorbars, and adjusting figure sizes. So, the Plotting and Visualization sub-query should cover using matplotlib to create these plots with proper configurations like titles and colorbars.

I need to make sure each sub-query is clear and targets only its specific domain without overlapping into others. Let me structure them accordingly.

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
How to print information about a NumPy array including shape, dtype, min, max values, and how to extract a bone map slice from rows 10 to 502 and columns 10 to 502 using indexing.

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
How to visualize slices of brain volume data using matplotlib, create image plots for different planes with titles, colorbars, and adjust figure size.
