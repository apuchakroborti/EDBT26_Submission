        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            A Python code that works with MRI brain data stored in an HDF5 file. Here's what I've gathered so far:

The code starts by defining two important file paths: 
`FAST_MRI_BRAIN_H5_FILE` which is located at 2_fastMRI_brain_first_10_dcm_to_h5.h5 and `FAST_MRI_BRAIN_H5_FILE_DATA_PATH` whole path is located below:
`FAST_MRI_BRAIN_ROOT/100099070170/279/fastMRI_brain_data`

Next, it reads data from the HDF5 file. Specifically, it extracts two datasets: `brain_2D_data` (a 2D slice of brain data). 
Both are read into memory using slicing notation.

The code then prints information about these datasets, including their contents, types, and shapes.

After that, it rotates the brain images for better visualization. 
For instance, a 2D slice of both rows and columns from 10 to 502 of the brain data is rotated by 270 degrees counter-clockwise using scipy.ndimage and displayed with a bone colormap. 
The axis labels are turned off, and the resulting plot is displayed. The code repeats this process for the coronal plane.

        Note: return only the the response of sub-queries only based on the below format, not explanation, not python code, and node additional text needed
        Return format:

        Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:

Okay, I need to break down the user's query into three specific sub-queries as per the guidelines. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, looking at the HDF5 Dataset Access section. The user is working with an HDF5 file and accessing datasets using specific paths. They mention reading `brain_2D_data` from a path like `/Grid/cloudWater`. So I should focus on how to access these datasets using h5py, including opening the file, navigating through groups, and extracting the data.

Next, for NumPy-based Data Preprocessing, the user is slicing data with [10:502, 10:502], which suggests they're handling subsets of their dataset. They also mention rotating images using scipy.ndimage, but since that's more about image processing, I should focus on any preprocessing steps they might need before visualization, like handling _FillValue or applying masks with NumPy functions.

Lastly, the Plotting and Visualization part involves using matplotlib to display rotated slices with a bone colormap. They also mention turning off axis labels and displaying coastlines, meridians, etc., but since this is MRI data, maybe it's more about standard plotting rather than geospatial projections. So I should focus on how to use matplotlib for image visualization, including colorbars and titles.

Putting it all together, each sub-query needs to be clear and specific to its domain without overlapping with the others.
