"""
        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            It starts by loading an HDF5 file located at `6_fastMRI_brain_first_10_dcm_to_h5.h5` in read-only mode.

The code then accesses a dataset within the HDF5 file from the dataset fastMRI_brain_data using full path `FAST_MRI_BRAIN_ROOT/100099070170/279/fastMRI_brain_data`, 
which represents 16 slices, 32 rows, and 512 columns. 

Two masks are created: one where values are greater than 10% of the maximum value, 
and another where values are less than 15% of the maximum value. 
The two masks are combined using element-wise addition, and then thresholded to create a final mask.

The code visualizes the mask using a gray colormap and slice of 20th column from 3D array that means it reads all values from x axis,
and z axis but only select the 20th slice from y axis, displaying a slice of the mask. 

In summary, this code loads an HDF5 file containing MRI data, reshapes the data into 3D, applies masking, and visualizes the results.

        Note: return only the the response of sub-queries only based on the below format, not explanation, not python code, and node additional text needed
        Return format:

Okay, so I need to break down the user's query into three specific sub-queries. Let me start by understanding each part of their task.

First, they're working with an HDF5 file. The file is located at `6_fastMRI_brain_first_10_dcm_to_h5.h5` and they open it in read-only mode. They access a dataset using the path `FAST_MRI_BRAIN_ROOT/100099070170/279/fastMRI_brain_data`. So, for the HDF5 sub-query, I should focus on how to access this specific dataset and its metadata.

Next, they process the data. They create two masks: one where values are greater than 10% of the max and another less than 15%. Then, they combine these masks using element-wise addition and threshold them. This involves handling _FillValue, using np.where or masked_where, and applying min/max for preprocessing.

Finally, they visualize the mask using matplotlib. They take a slice from the y-axis (20th column) and display it with a gray colormap, including coastlines, meridians, parallels, colorbar, and title. So, the visualization sub-query should cover how to plot this geospatial data correctly.

I need to make sure each sub-query is clear and targets only its specific domain without overlapping.
