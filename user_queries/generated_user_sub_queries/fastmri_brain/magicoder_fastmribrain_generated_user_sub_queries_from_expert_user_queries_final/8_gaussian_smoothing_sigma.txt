"""
        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            It starts by loading an HDF5 file located at `8_fastMRI_brain_first_10_dcm_to_h5.h5` in read-only mode.

The code then accesses a dataset named fastMRI_brain_data where the dataset is located by full path `FAST_MRI_BRAIN_ROOT/100099070170/279/fastMRI_brain_data`, 
which represents 16 slices, 32 rows, and 512 columns. 

Next, Gaussian smoothing from scipy.ndimage is applied to the original MRI volume with a sigma value of 2, reducing noise in the image.
Set the fig_rows and fig_cols to 4, then calculate the n_subplots by multiplying fig_rows and fig_cols, calculates step_size dividing n_slice by n_subplots,
then calculates plot_range by multiplying n_subplots and step_size, then it calculates start_stop from the difference of n_slice and plot_range and divides by 2

The program creates a figure with multiple subplots by using a loop by enumerating from the range of start_stop to plot_range by increasing using step_size,
set imshow by slicing data from the x axis, 
Multiple slices of the smoothed MRI volume are plotted using multiple subplots.

In summary, this code loads an HDF5 file containing MRI data, reshapes the data into 3D, applies Gaussian smoothing, and visualizes the results.
