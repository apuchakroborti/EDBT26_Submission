"""
        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            It loads brain MRI data from an HDF5 file and plots slices through the volume. 

The program starts by defining file paths: `FAST_MRI_BRAIN_H5_FILE` which is 3_fastMRI_brain_first_10_dcm_to_h5.h5 for the HDF5 file containing brain MRI data, 
and `FAST_MRI_BRAIN_H5_FILE_DATA_PATH` where full path is located at `FAST_MRI_BRAIN_ROOT/100099070170/279/fastMRI_brain_data` within the HDF5 hierarchy.

It then loads the HDF5 file, accesses the brain MRI data, and reshapes it into a 3D array with shape `(16, 32, 512)`.

Next, it defines plot parameters: `fig_rows`, `fig_cols`, `n_subplots`, `n_slice`, `step_size`, `plot_range`, and `start_stop` to control the plotting process.
Set the fig_rows and fig_cols to 4, then calculate the n_subplots by multiplying fig_rows and fig_cols, calculates step_size dividing n_slice by n_subplots,
then calculates plot_range by multiplying n_subplots and step_size, then it calculates start_stop from the difference of n_slice and plot_range and divides by 2

The program creates a figure with multiple subplots by using a loop by enumerating from the range of start_stop to plot_range by increasing by step_size,
set imshow by slicing data from the x axis , plots brain MRI slices as grayscale images, and turns off axis labels for each subplot. 
Finally, it applies tight layout and displays the figure.

 HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
