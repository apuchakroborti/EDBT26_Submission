"""
        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            It starts by loading an HDF5 file located at `6_fastMRI_brain_first_10_dcm_to_h5.h5` in read-only mode.

The code then accesses a dataset within the HDF5 file from the dataset fastMRI_brain_data using full path `FAST_MRI_BRAIN_ROOT/100099070170/279/fastMRI_brain_data`, 
which represents 16 slices, 32 rows, and 512 columns. 

Two masks are created: one where values are greater than 10% of the maximum value, 
and another where values are less than 15% of the maximum value. 
The two masks are combined using element-wise addition, and then thresholded to create a final mask.

The code visualizes the mask using a gray colormap and slice of 20th column from 3D array that means it reads all values from x axis,
and z axis but only select the 20th slice from y axis, displaying a slice of the mask. 

In summary, this code loads an HDF5 file containing MRI data, reshapes the data into 3D, applies masking, and visualizes the results.

 HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
```python
import h5py

# Open the file in read mode
with h5py.File('6_fastMRI_brain_first_10_dcm_to_h5.h5', 'r') as f:

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
```python
import numpy as np

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
```python
