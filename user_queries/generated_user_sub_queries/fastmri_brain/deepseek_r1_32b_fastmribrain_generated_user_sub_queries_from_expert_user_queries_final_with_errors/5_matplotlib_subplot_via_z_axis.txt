        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            The code starts by defining file paths: 
`FAST_MRI_BRAIN_H5_FILE` located at 5_fastMRI_brain_first_10_dcm_to_h5.h5 for an HDF5 file containing brain MRI data 
and `FAST_MRI_BRAIN_H5_FILE_DATA_PATH` where the path is sub group path is 100099070170/279 
where the dataset fastMRI_brain_data is located to access the brain MRI data within the HDF5 file.

It then loads the HDF5 file in read mode and extracts the brain MRI data from the file. 
The extracted 2D dataset, representing a slice of the brain MRI volume, is assigned to `brain_vol`.

The code reshapes the 2D dataset into a 3D array, where each slice of the brain MRI volume is represented by a 2D array. 
This is done to group every 512 columns into slices.

Next, it plots the coronal plane of the brain MRI volume using matplotlib. 
It defines the number of rows and columns for the plot, calculates the step size to iterate over the slices, 
and creates a figure with subplots. Each slice is rotated by 270 degrees using scipy.ndimage and displayed in a subplot with the axis turned off.

It sets the values of fig and axs from subplots of fig_rows, fig_cols, and fig_size of values 15 and 31

Set the fig_rows and fig_cols to 4, then calculate the n_subplots by multiplying fig_rows and fig_cols, calculates step_size dividing n_slice by n_subplots,
then calculates plot_range by multiplying n_subplots and step_size, then it calculates start_stop from the difference of n_slice and plot_range and divides by 2

The program creates a figure with multiple subplots by using a loop by enumerating from the range of start_stop to plot_range by increasing by step_size,
set imshow by slicing data from the z axis,

Finally, the code displays the plot. The goal is to load brain MRI data from an HDF5 file, reshape it into a 3D array, 
and visualize the coronal plane of the brain MRI volume.

Okay, so I need to break down this user query into three specific sub-queries. Let me read through the problem again carefully.

The user provided a detailed code description that involves accessing an HDF5 file, reshaping data with NumPy, and plotting using matplotlib. My task is to split this into three focused areas: HDF5 access, NumPy preprocessing, and visualization.

First, for the HDF5 part, I see they're opening a specific file path and accessing a dataset within a subgroup. So the sub-query should focus on how to use h5py to open the file, navigate through groups, and extract the dataset.

Next, the data is reshaped into a 3D array from a 2D dataset. This involves NumPy operations like reshaping and possibly handling any missing or fill values. The sub-query here should cover these preprocessing steps using NumPy functions.

Lastly, the visualization part uses matplotlib to create multiple subplots of MRI slices in the coronal plane. They mention setting up rows, columns, step sizes, and rotating images. So the sub-query needs to address how to plot these slices with proper configuration, including projections and aesthetics like turning off axes.

I need to make sure each sub-query is clear and targets only its specific domain without overlapping into others.

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
How to access an HDF5 file using h5py from a specified file path, navigate through groups (e.g., '100099070170/279'), and extract the dataset named 'fastMRI_brain_data'?

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
How to reshape a 2D NumPy array into a 3D array by grouping every 512 columns into slices for MRI data processing?

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
How to plot multiple coronal slices of brain MRI data using matplotlib, with specific subplot arrangement (4 rows), step size calculation, image rotation (270 degrees), and axis configuration?
