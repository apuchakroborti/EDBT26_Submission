        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            A Python code that works with MRI brain data stored in an HDF5 file. Here's what I've gathered so far:

The code starts by defining two important file paths: 
`FAST_MRI_BRAIN_H5_FILE` which is located at 2_fastMRI_brain_first_10_dcm_to_h5.h5 and `FAST_MRI_BRAIN_H5_FILE_DATA_PATH` whole path is 

root group is FAST_MRI_BRAIN_ROOT parent sub group is 279 and dataset is fastMRI_brain_data. The latter is a path within the HDF5 file to access the brain data.

Next, it reads data from the HDF5 file. Specifically, it extracts two datasets: `brain_2D_data` (a 2D slice of brain data). 
Both are read into memory using slicing notation.

The code then prints information about these datasets, including their contents, types, and shapes.

After that, it rotates the brain images for better visualization. 
For instance, a 2D slice of both rows and columns from 10 to 502 of the brain data is rotated by 270 degrees counter-clockwise and displayed with a bone colormap. 
The axis labels are turned off, and the resulting plot is displayed.

The code repeats this process for the coronal plane.

Overall, it seems like this program is designed for visualizing and exploring MRI brain data stored in an HDF5 file. 
It extracts specific datasets from the file, rotates them for better visualization, and displays them using Matplotlib.

Alright, I need to break down the user's query into three specific sub-queries as per the guidelines. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, looking at the HDF5 Dataset Access section. The user is working with an HDF5 file containing MRI brain data. They mention accessing datasets using paths like `FAST_MRI_BRAIN_ROOT` and `279/fastMRI_brain_data`. So, I should focus on how to use h5py to open the file, access these specific groups and datasets, retrieve metadata, and handle attributes.

Next, for NumPy-based Data Preprocessing. The user extracts 2D slices from the dataset and then rotates them by 270 degrees. This involves using NumPy functions like slicing and rotation. I need to frame a sub-query that addresses how to perform these operations efficiently in NumPy, possibly including any preprocessing steps like handling data types or ensuring correct dimensions.

Lastly, the Plotting and Visualization part uses matplotlib to display the rotated images with specific colormaps and axis settings. The user also mentions visualizing both axial and coronal planes. So, the sub-query should cover how to create these plots using matplotlib, including setting up the figure, applying transformations, color schemes, and turning off axes.

I need to ensure each sub-query is clear and targets only its specific domain without overlapping with others.
