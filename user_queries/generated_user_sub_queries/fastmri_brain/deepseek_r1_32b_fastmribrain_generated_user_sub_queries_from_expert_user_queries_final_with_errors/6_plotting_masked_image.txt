"""
        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            It starts by loading an HDF5 file located at `6_fastMRI_brain_first_10_dcm_to_h5.h5` in read-only mode.

The code then accesses a dataset within the HDF5 file from the dataset fastMRI_brain_data from the sub group 279 and root group FAST_MRI_BRAIN_ROOT, 
which represents 16 slices, 32 rows, and 512 columns. 

Two masks are created: one where values are greater than 10% of the maximum value, 
and another where values are less than 15% of the maximum value. 
The two masks are combined using element-wise addition, and then thresholded to create a final mask.

The code visualizes the mask using a gray colormap and slice of 20th column from 3D array that means it reads all values from x axis,
and z axis but only select the 20th slice from y axis, displaying a slice of the mask. 

In summary, this code loads an HDF5 file containing MRI data, reshapes the data into 3D, applies masking, and visualizes the results.

        Note: return only the the response of sub-queries only based on the below format, not explanation, not python code, and node additional text needed
        Return format:

Okay, I need to break down the user's query into three specific sub-queries based on the given categories. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, looking at the HDF5 Dataset Access section. The user is loading an HDF5 file and accessing a dataset within it. They mention the file path, the group structure (FAST_MRI_BRAIN_ROOT and subgroup 279), and the dataset name fastMRI_brain_data. So I should focus on how to access this specific dataset using h5py.

Next, for NumPy-based Data Preprocessing, the user creates two masks based on percentages of the maximum value and combines them. They also reshape the data into a 3D array. My sub-query needs to cover creating these masks using np.where or similar functions, combining them, and applying thresholds.

Lastly, the Plotting and Visualization part involves using matplotlib to display a slice of the mask with specific parameters like gray colormap, axis labels, and title. I should focus on how to visualize this data correctly, including setting up the plot and adding necessary elements.

Putting it all together, each sub-query should clearly target one technical domain without overlapping.

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
How to access the dataset 'fastMRI_brain_data' from subgroup 279 under root group FAST_MRI_BRAIN_ROOT in the HDF5 file located at '6_fastMRI_brain_first_10_dcm_to_h5.h5' using h5py?

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
How to create two masks where one is values greater than 10% of the maximum value and another is less than 15% of the maximum value, combine them using element-wise addition, and threshold to create a final mask in NumPy?

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
How to visualize a slice from a 3D array (20th column) using matplotlib with gray colormap, displaying coastlines, meridians, parallels, colorbar, and title?
