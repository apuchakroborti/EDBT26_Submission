        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            The code starts by defining two constants: `FAST_MRI_BRAIN_H5_FILE` (the path to the HDF5 file) which is located at 1_fastMRI_brain_first_10_dcm_to_h5.h5 
and `FAST_MRI_BRAIN_H5_FILE_DATA_PATH` (the path within the HDF5 file where the brain volume data is stored) 
which read from FAST_MRI_BRAIN_ROOT root group, 
sub group is 100099070170 and immediate parent sub-group is 279 and dataset is fastMRI_brain_data.

It then opens the HDF5 file in read mode, accessing the brain volume data by navigating to the specified path FAST_MRI_BRAIN_H5_FILE_DATA_PATH. 
It reads all data along all axes, storing it in the `brain_vol` variable.

The code prints information about the `brain_vol` data and visualizes a slice through different planes of the brain volume data using image plots. 
Specifically, it creates plots of bone map (a slice from 10 to 502 from both the rows and columns) , using indexing to select specific slices from the 2D array.

        Note: return only the the response of sub-queries only based on the below format, not explanation, not python code, and node additional text needed
        Return format:

Okay, I need to break down the user's query into three specific sub-queries as per the guidelines. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, looking at the HDF5 Dataset Access section. The user mentions opening an HDF5 file and accessing a specific dataset path. So the sub-query should focus on how to use h5py to open the file and retrieve data from that exact path. I'll make sure to include the file extensions and the dataset path as specified.

Next, for NumPy-based Data Preprocessing, the user talks about reading all data into brain_vol and then slicing it. The sub-query should cover handling any _FillValue if present, using numpy functions like np.where or masked arrays, and how to slice the data. I'll phrase it to ask about techniques for preprocessing such slices.

Lastly, the Plotting and Visualization part involves creating image plots of specific slices. The user uses matplotlib to visualize these slices with bone map. So the sub-query should focus on using matplotlib to plot 2D slices, including setting up the figure, adding titles, colorbars, and ensuring proper visualization techniques are applied.

I need to ensure each sub-query is clear and targets only its respective domain without overlapping information.

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
How to use h5py to open an HDF5 file located at 1_fastMRI_brain_first_10_dcm_to_h5.h5 and access the dataset at the path /FAST_MRI_BRAIN_ROOT/100099070170/279/fastMRI_brain_data?

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
How to handle _FillValue in NumPy arrays when reading data from an HDF5 file, apply masks using np.where or np.ma.masked_where, and slice a 3D brain volume dataset into specific planes for visualization?

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
How to use matplotlib to visualize a 2D slice of brain MRI data with bone map, including setting up the figure, adding titles, colorbars, and ensuring proper visualization techniques?
