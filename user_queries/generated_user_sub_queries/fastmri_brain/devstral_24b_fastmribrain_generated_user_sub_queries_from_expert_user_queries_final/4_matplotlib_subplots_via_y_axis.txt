"""
        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            This code is part of an application for visualizing and analyzing brain MRI data stored in HDF5 files. Here's how it works:

File Paths and Variables
The code defines two file paths: `FAST_MRI_BRAIN_H5_FILE` is located at 4_fastMRI_brain_first_10_dcm_to_h5.h5 and `FAST_MRI_BRAIN_H5_FILE_DATA_PATH`, 
which points to a specific dataset  such as `FAST_MRI_BRAIN_ROOT/100099070170/279/fastMRI_brain_data` within the HDF5 file.

Reading Data from HDF5 File
The code reads data from the HDF5 file. It opens the file in read mode and assigns it to a variable. 
Then, it reads the dataset at the specified path and assigns it to a variable `brain_vol`.

Reshaping Data
The 2D dataset is reshaped into a 3D array with shape `(16, 32, 512)` using the `reshape()` method.

Plotting Data
The code sets up a figure with multiple subplots using `matplotlib`. It defines the number of rows and columns for the subplot grid, as well as the total number of subplots. 
Then, it iterates over a range of slice indices and plots each slice using `imshow()`, applying a 270-degree rotation to align the slices with the correct orientation using scipy.ndimage.

Implementation Details
The HDF5 file contains a dataset at the path `FAST_MRI_BRAIN_H5_FILE_DATA_PATH`, which is read into memory as a 2D array.
The 2D array is reshaped into a 3D array with shape `(16, 32, 512)`.
Each slice is rotated by 270 degrees to align it with the correct orientation.

Set the fig_rows and fig_cols to 4, then calculate the n_subplots by multiplying fig_rows and fig_cols, calculates step_size dividing n_slice by n_subplots,
then calculates plot_range by multiplying n_subplots and step_size, then it calculates start_stop from the difference of n_slice and plot_range and divides by 2
The program creates a figure with multiple subplots by using a loop by enumerating from the range of start_stop to plot_range by increasing by step_size,
set imshow by slicing data from the y axis,  

plots brain MRI slices as grayscale images, and turns off axis labels for each subplot.
