        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            1. File Input and Constants
   - Specify the input file `MOP02N-20180311-L2V19.9.2.he5` stored in the constant `FILE_NAME`.
   - Import necessary libraries: `os`, `datetime`, `h5py`, `numpy` as `np`, `matplotlib` as `mpl`, `matplotlib.pyplot` as `plt`, and `mpl_toolkits.basemap.Basemap`.

2. Extracting Data
   - Extract data from the HDF5 dataset at `/HDFEOS/SWATHS/MOP02/Data Fields/RetrievedCOTotalColumn`.
   - Read the contents into an array called `data`, taking only the first column.
   - Retrieve the `units` and `_FillValue` attributes associated with this dataset.
   - Replace the `_FillValue` in the `RetrievedCOTotalColumn` data with `numpy.nan`.

3. Extracting Geolocation Data
   - Extract latitude values from `/HDFEOS/SWATHS/MOP02/Geolocation Fields/Latitude`.
   - Extract longitude values from `/HDFEOS/SWATHS/MOP02/Geolocation Fields/Longitude`.

4. Creating a Map
   - Add coastlines with a line width of 0.5.
   - Draw parallels using `numpy.arange(-90, 91, 45)`.
   - Draw meridians using `numpy.arange(-180, 181, 45)` and set labels to `[True, False, False, True]`.

5. Scatter Plot
   - Create a scatter plot with parameters: longitude, latitude, data array `c=data`, marker size `s=1`, colormap `plt.cm.jet`, no edge colors (`edgecolors=None`), and line width `linewidth=0`.

6. Customizing the Map
   - Add a colorbar to represent the units of the data.
   - Set the colorbar label using the `units` attribute from the dataset.

Okay, so I need to break down the user's query into three specific sub-queries. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, looking at the user's task, they're dealing with an HDF5 file named `MOP02N-20180311-L2V19.9.2.he5`. They want to access this file using h5py and extract specific datasets like `/HDFEOS/SWATHS/MOP02/Data Fields/RetrievedCOTotalColumn` along with its attributes such as units and _FillValue. So, the first sub-query should focus on how to use h5py to open the file, access these datasets, retrieve their attributes, and handle metadata.

Next, they're dealing with data preprocessing using NumPy. They need to replace the _FillValue in their data array with NaNs. This involves understanding how to identify and manipulate masked values or specific fill values in a NumPy array. So, the second sub-query should cover techniques for handling _FillValue, applying masks, and any necessary preprocessing steps like min, max, etc.

Lastly, they want to visualize this data on a map using matplotlib's Basemap toolkit. They need to create a scatter plot with longitude and latitude, add coastlines, draw parallels and meridians at specific intervals, and include a colorbar labeled with the units from their dataset. The third sub-query should focus on how to set up the map projection, customize the plot elements, and ensure all these visual aspects are correctly implemented.

I need to make sure each sub-query is clear and targets only one technical domain as specified. Let me structure them accordingly.

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
How to replace _FillValue in a NumPy array with NaNs, handle masked data using np.where or np.ma.masked_where, and process the first column of an HDF5 dataset for visualization.

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
How to create a map plot using matplotlib's Basemap toolkit, add coastlines, draw parallels and meridians at specified intervals, generate a scatter plot with longitude and latitude data, customize the colorbar with units from the dataset, and set appropriate labels.
