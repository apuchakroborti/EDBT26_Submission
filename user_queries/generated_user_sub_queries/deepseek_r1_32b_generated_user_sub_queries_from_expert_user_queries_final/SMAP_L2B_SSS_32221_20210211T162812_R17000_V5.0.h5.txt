        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            A Python script that performs the following tasks using the specified libraries and steps:

1. Import Libraries: Include os, matplotlib as mpl, matplotlib.pyplot as plt, Basemap from mpl_toolkits.basemap, numpy as np, and h5py.

2. Read HDF5 File: Open the file 'SMAP_L2B_SSS_32221_20210211T162812_R17000_V5.0.h5' in read-only mode using h5py.

3. Extract Datasets and Attributes:
   - Extract datasets: '/lat', '/lon', and '/smap_spd'.
   - Retrieve attributes from 'smap_spd': units, long_name, and _FillValue.

4. Data Processing:
   - Replace _FillValue in 'smap_spd' with NaN.
   - Apply a mask using masked_where with parameters: isnan(smap_spd) and smap_spd itself.

5. Create Map Visualization:
   - Use Basemap to create an equidistant cylindrical projection map with low resolution ('l').
   - Draw coastlines with a line width of 0.5.
   - Set parallels using numpy.arange(-180, 91, 45) and meridians using numpy.arange(-180, 180, 45).

6. Plot Data:
   - Use scatter plot with longitude vs latitude, data from smap_spd, marker size 1, colormap 'jet', no edge colors or linewidths.

7. Enhance Visualization:
   - Add a colorbar labeled with the units of 'smap_spd'.
   - Set the title as the concatenation of the HDF5 file's basename and the long_name attribute from 'smap_spd'.

8. Save and Cleanup:
   - Save the plot as a PNG file.
   - Close the figure properly.

Alright, I need to break down the user's query into three specific sub-queries as per their instructions. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, looking at the HDF5 Dataset Access section. The user wants to open a specific HDF5 file and extract certain datasets and attributes. So, the sub-query should focus on using h5py to access these elements. I'll make sure to mention opening the file in read-only mode, extracting 'lat', 'lon', and 'smap_spd' datasets, and retrieving the attributes from 'smap_spd'.

Next, for NumPy-based Data Preprocessing, the user needs to handle _FillValue by replacing it with NaN and then apply a mask. I'll structure the sub-query around these two main steps: replacing values and masking using np.where or np.ma.masked_where.

Lastly, the Plotting and Visualization part involves creating a map using Basemap, drawing specific elements like coastlines, parallels, and meridians, plotting data with scatter, adding a colorbar, setting a title, saving the plot, and cleaning up. I'll ensure each of these steps is clearly addressed in the sub-query.

I need to make sure each sub-query is concise and only targets its specific domain without overlapping into others. Also, avoiding any markdown or extra explanations as per the user's request.

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
How to replace _FillValue in a NumPy array with NaN and apply a mask using np.where or np.ma.masked_where based on isnan conditions for data filtering.

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
How to create a map visualization using Basemap with an equidistant cylindrical projection, draw coastlines, parallels, and meridians, plot data as a scatter plot with specified parameters, add a colorbar with units, set a title combining file basename and dataset long_name, save the plot as PNG, and close the figure properly.
