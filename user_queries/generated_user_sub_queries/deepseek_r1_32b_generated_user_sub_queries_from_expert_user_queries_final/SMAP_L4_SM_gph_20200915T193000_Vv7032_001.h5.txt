        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            A Python script that processes and visualizes data from an HDF5 file using specific libraries and steps:

1. Import Libraries: Include os, numpy as np, mpl_toolkits.basemap import Basemap, and matplotlib.pyplot as plt.

2. Define File: Use the HDF5 file 'SMAP_L4_SM_gph_20200915T193000_Vv7032_001.h5'.

3. Open File: Access the file in read-only mode.

4. Read Datasets:
   - Extract `/Geophysical_Data/sm_profile` into an array called `data`.
   - Read latitude from `/cell_lat/` and longitude from `/cell_lon/`.

5. Extract Attributes: From `sm_profile`, retrieve units, long_name, _FillValue, valid_max, and valid_min.

6. Decode Parameters: Use ascii decoding for units and long_name.

7. Identify Invalid Data:
   - Use numpy's logical_or to find data beyond valid_max or below valid_min.
   - Update with data equal to _FillValue.

8. Set NaN Values: Replace invalid data with numpy NaNs.

9. Create Masked Array: Apply numpy masked_where using isnan(data) and the data itself.

10. Map Setup:
    - Use Basemap for an equidistant cylindrical projection, low resolution.
    - Draw coastlines with linewidth 0.5.
    - Set parallels at from the result of nummpy array (start, stop, interval) with parameters [-180, 91, 45] 
    and meridians at from the values of nummpy array (start, stop, interval) [-180, 180, 45].

11. Data Visualization:
    - Scatter plot with longitude, latitude, data, s=1, cmap=jet, no edgecolor or linewidth.

12. Colorbar and Title:
    - Add colorbar labeled with units from sm_profile.
    - Set title as the concatenation of the HDF5 file's basename and sm_profile's long_name, font size 10.

Alright, I need to break down the user's query into three specific sub-queries. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, looking at the HDF5 Dataset Access section. The user is working with an HDF5 file named 'SMAP_L4_SM_gph_20200915T193000_Vv7032_001.h5'. They want to access several datasets and attributes. So, the sub-query should focus on opening this file using h5py, extracting the specific datasets like 'sm_profile', latitude, and longitude. Also, they need to read attributes such as units, long_name, _FillValue, valid_max, and valid_min from the dataset. Decoding these attributes using ASCII is important too.

Next, for NumPy-based Data Preprocessing, the user wants to identify invalid data points. This includes data beyond valid_max or below valid_min, as well as values equal to _FillValue. They plan to replace these invalid points with NaNs and create a masked array where the data is NaN. The sub-query should cover using numpy's logical_or for identifying invalid data, setting NaNs, and applying masked_where.

Lastly, the Plotting and Visualization section involves setting up a map using Basemap with an equidistant cylindrical projection. They need to draw coastlines, parallels, and meridians at specific intervals. The visualization includes a scatter plot of the data, adding a colorbar labeled with the dataset's units, and setting a title that combines the file name and long_name attribute.

I'll structure each sub-query to address these points clearly without any extra explanations or code.

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
How to access an HDF5 file named 'SMAP_L4_SM_gph_20200915T193000_Vv7032_001.h5' using h5py, extract the dataset '/Geophysical_Data/sm_profile', read latitude from '/cell_lat/' and longitude from '/cell_lon/', retrieve attributes units, long_name, _FillValue, valid_max, and valid_min from sm_profile, and decode parameters using ascii.

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
How to identify invalid data in a NumPy array by finding values beyond valid_max or below valid_min, updating with data equal to _FillValue, replacing invalid data with numpy NaNs, and creating a masked array using numpy masked_where with isnan(data).

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
How to use Basemap for an equidistant cylindrical projection, draw coastlines with linewidth 0.5, set parallels from [-180, 91, 45] and meridians from [-180, 180, 45], create a scatter plot with longitude, latitude, data, s=1, cmap=jet, add colorbar labeled with units, and set title as the concatenation of the HDF5 file's basename and sm_profile's long_name with font size 10.
