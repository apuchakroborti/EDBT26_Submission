        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            Create a Python script that processes an HDF5 file and generates a split-window plot with specific visualizations.

1. Import Libraries: Include os, cartopy.crs, matplotlib, matplotlib.pyplot, numpy, and datetime for handling OS functions, map projections, plotting, numerical operations, and date/time processing.

2. Define Constants: Set `FILE_NAME` to "ATL12_20190330212241_00250301_006_03.h5".

3. Open HDF5 File: Read the file in read mode and access these datasets:
   - `/gpsr/navigation/latitude`
   - `/gpsr/navigation/longitude`
   - `/atlas/pce1/background/bg_cnt_50shot_s` (main data)
   - `/atlas/pce1/background/delta_time` (time data)

4. Extract Attributes: For the bg_cnt_50shot_s dataset, read 'units' and 'long_name' attributes using decode('ascii', 'replace').

5. Create Plots:
   - First Plot (Time vs. Counts): 
     - Set figure size to 10x10.
     - Use subplot ax1 at position 2,1,1.
     - Calculate elapsed_time by subtracting the first time value from each time point.
     - Plot elapsed_time vs. main data with blue circles.
     - Label axes with time units and main data units.
     - Set title combining the file name, dataset name, and long_name.

   - Second Plot (Trajectory Map):
     - Calculate midpoint latitude (lat_m) and longitude (lon_m).
     - Use cartopy's orthographic projection centered at lat_m and lon_m.
     - Enable gridlines with labels and degrees, minutes, seconds (dms).
     - Display global features and coastlines.
     - Plot trajectory in blue, using Geodetic transformation.
     - Mark the starting point with a red circle and label "START" offset by 200 km.

6. Adjust Layout: Use tight layout with padding of 3.0 for proper spacing.

Okay, so I need to break down the user's query into three specific sub-queries. Let me start by understanding what each part of their task involves.

First, they want to process an HDF5 file. That means using h5py to access datasets and attributes. They mentioned specific paths like `/gpsr/navigation/latitude` and others, so I should focus on how to open the file, read these datasets, and extract attributes with decoding.

Next, for data preprocessing, they're dealing with NumPy arrays. They need to handle _FillValue, which means identifying and masking invalid data points. Also, calculating elapsed_time by subtracting the first time value from each point is a key step here. I should think about how to apply masks using np.where or masked_where and compute min/max if needed.

Lastly, visualization with matplotlib and cartopy. They want two plots: one showing time vs. counts and another for the trajectory map. The second plot requires setting up an orthographic projection, adding gridlines, coastlines, and plotting the trajectory with a starting point marked. I need to ensure the sub-query covers all these aspects without getting into code specifics.

Putting it all together, each sub-query should be clear and focused on its domain, making it easier to retrieve relevant information from documentation or examples.
