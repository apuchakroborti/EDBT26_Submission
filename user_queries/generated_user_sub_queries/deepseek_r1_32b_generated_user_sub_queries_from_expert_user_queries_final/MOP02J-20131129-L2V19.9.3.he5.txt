        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            File Input and Constants
- Specify the input file as `MOP02J-20131129-L2V19.9.3.he5` stored in the constant `FILE_NAME`.
- Import necessary libraries: `os`, `datetime`, `h5py`, `numpy` as `np`, `matplotlib` as `mpl`, `matplotlib.pyplot` as `plt`, and `mpl_toolkits.basemap.Basemap`.

Extracting Data
- Extract data from the HDF5 dataset at `/HDFEOS/SWATHS/MOP02/Data Fields/RetrievedSurfaceTemperature`.
- Read the first column of this dataset into an array named `data`.
- Retrieve the `units` and `_FillValue` attributes associated with the RetrievedSurfaceTemperaturehis dataset.
- Decode the `units` string using the `decode()` function.

Data Preprocessing and Cleaning
- Replace values in `data` that match `_FillValue` with `numpy.nan`.

Extracting Geolocation Data
- Extract latitude data from `/HDFEOS/SWATHS/MOP02/Geolocation Fields/Latitude`.
- Extract longitude data from `/HDFEOS/SWATHS/MOP02/Geolocation Fields/Longitude`.

Creating a Map
- Add coastlines with a line width of 0.5.
- Draw parallels using `numpy.arange(-90, 91, 45)`.
- Draw meridians using `numpy.arange(-180, 180, 45)` and set labels to `[True, False, False, True]`.

Scatter Plot Configuration
- Use the `scatter` function with parameters: longitude, latitude, `c=data`, marker size `s=1`, colormap `plt.cm.jet`, no edge colors (`edgecolors=None`), and line width `linewidth=0`.

Customizing the Map
- Add a colorbar to represent data units.
- Set the colorbar label using the decoded `units` value.

<think>
Okay, so I need to break down this user query into three specific sub-queries. Let me read through the user's instructions carefully.

First, the user is working with an HDF5 file named `MOP02J-20131129-L2V19.9.3.he5`. They want to access data from this file using h5py. The main tasks here are extracting specific datasets and their attributes. So for the HDF5 sub-query, I should focus on accessing the dataset at `/HDFEOS/SWATHS/MOP02/Data Fields/RetrievedSurfaceTemperature`, reading the first column into an array called `data`, and retrieving the `units` and `_FillValue` attributes.

Next, the data preprocessing part involves handling the `_FillValue`. They want to replace these values in `data` with NaNs using NumPy. So the sub-query here should cover how to use NumPy functions like np.where or masked arrays to achieve this.

Lastly, for plotting, they're using matplotlib and Basemap. The tasks include creating a map with coastlines, drawing parallels and meridians at 45-degree intervals, adding a colorbar labeled with the units, and configuring the scatter plot correctly. I need to make sure the sub-query captures all these visualization aspects.

I should structure each sub-query clearly, ensuring they target their respective domains without overlapping. Let me draft each part step by step.

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
How to replace values in a NumPy array that match a specific `_FillValue` with `numpy.nan`.

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
How to create a map using `matplotlib` and `Basemap`, add coastlines, draw parallels and meridians at 45-degree intervals, configure a scatter plot with longitude, latitude, and data values, and customize the colorbar with units.
