"""
        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            Create a Python script that reads an HDF5 file and generates a map visualization by following these steps:

1. Import Libraries: Include os, matplotlib, matplotlib.pyplot, numpy, mpl_toolkits.basemap, and h5py.

2. Read HDF5 File: Open the file `AMSR_E_L2_Land_V11_201110031920_D.he5` in read-only mode.

3. Extract Data:
   - Retrieve main data from the attribute 'SoilMoistureSCA' at `/HDFEOS/POINTS/AMSR-E Level 2 Land Data/Data/Combined NPD and SCA Output Fields`.
   - Extract latitude data from `/HDFEOS/POINTS/AMSR-E Level 2 Land Data/Data/Combined NPD and SCA Output Fields/Latitude`.
   - Extract longitude data from `/HDFEOS/POINTS/AMSR-E Level 2 Land Data/Data/Combined NPD and SCA Output Fields/Longitude`.

4. Data Cleaning:
   - Assign a static _FillValue of -9999.0.
   - Replace values matching _FillValue with numpy NaN.
   - Mask data using numpy's masked_array where values are not NaN.

5. Create Map:
   - Use an equidistant cylindrical projection with low resolution.
   - Set latitude range from -90 to 90 and longitude from -170 to 190.
   - Add coastlines with a linewidth of 0.5.
   - Draw parallels using numpy arrange with values -90, 91, 45 and labels [1, 0, 0, 0].
   - Draw meridians using numpy arrange with values -180, 181, 45 and labels [0, 0, 0, 1].

6. Scatter Plot:
   - Use longitude and latitude data.
   - Set parameters: marker size (s=0.1), colormap (plt.cm.jet), edgecolors=None, linewidth=0.

7. Add Colorbar and Title:
   - Include a colorbar labeled with the dataset's units.
   - Set title to include the file basename and 'SoilMoistureSCA'.

Okay, so I need to create a Python script that reads an HDF5 file and generates a map visualization. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll start with importing the necessary libraries: os, matplotlib, matplotlib.pyplot, numpy, mpl_toolkits.basemap, and h5py. That's straightforward.

Next, I need to read the HDF5 file. The filename is 'AMSR_E_L2_Land_V11_201110031920_D.he5', so I'll open it in read-only mode using h5py. I remember that HDF5 files have a hierarchical structure, so I need to navigate through the groups and datasets.

The main data is stored under the attribute 'SoilMoistureSCA' at the path '/HDFEOS/POINTS/AMSR-E Level 2 Land Data/Data/Combined NPD and SCA Output Fields'. So I'll access this dataset. Similarly, I need to extract latitude and longitude data from their respective paths.

Once I have the data, I need to clean it. The _FillValue is -9999.0, so I'll replace all occurrences of this value with NaN using NumPy. Then, I'll create a masked array where these NaN values are masked out. This will help in visualization by ignoring invalid data points.

For the map visualization, I'll use matplotlib and basemap. The projection should be equidistant cylindrical with low resolution. I'll set the latitude range from -90 to 90 and longitude from -170 to 190. Adding coastlines with a linewidth of 0.5 will make the map more readable.

Drawing parallels and meridians is next. Parallels should be at intervals of 45 degrees, starting from -90 up to 90, with labels only on the bottom. Meridians will also be every 45 degrees, but labels will be on the right side.

Finally, I'll create a scatter plot using longitude and latitude data. The markers should be small (s=0.1), using the jet colormap without edges. Adding a colorbar with the dataset's units and setting an appropriate title that includes the file basename and 'SoilMoistureSCA' will complete the visualization.

I think I've covered all the steps, but I need to make sure each part is correctly implemented in Python. Maybe I should look up some examples for accessing HDF5 files with h5py and using basemap for projections. Also, handling NaNs properly is crucial to avoid errors in plotting.
