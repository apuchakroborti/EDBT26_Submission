        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            A Python script that reads an HDF5 file containing ASTER GED data, extracts specific datasets, and visualizes them on a map.

1. Import necessary libraries: os, matplotlib, matplotlib.pyplot, numpy, mpl_toolkits.basemap, h5py.

2. Read the input HDF5 file in read-only mode.

3. Extract datasets:
   - 'Mean Emissivity for Band 10' from '/Emissivity/Mean' as a 2D slice (1st index along x-axis).
   - Retrieve the Description attribute's 0th value.
   - Set units to None and long_name to 'Mean emissivity for Band 10'.

4. Extract geolocation data:
   - Latitude from '/Geolocation/Latitude'.
   - Longitude from '/Geolocation/Longitude'.

5. Process mean data:
   - Replace -9999 with NaN.
   - Scale by multiplying with 0.001.
   - Apply mask using numpy's masked_where.

6. Create an equidistant cylindrical projection map with Basemap, setting latitude (62.5-64.5) and longitude (89.5-87.5) ranges.

7. Add map features:
   - Coastlines with linewidth 0.5.
   - Parallels at 62, 63, 64 with specific labels of [1, 0, 0, 0]
   - Meridians at -89, -88, -87 with specific labels of [0, 0, 0, 1]

8. Plot data using pcolormesh with latlon=True.

9. Add colorbar labeled 'None' and a title combining the filename's base name with 'Mean Emissivity for Band 10'.

<think>
Okay, so I need to break down this user query into three specific sub-queries. The user is asking for a Python script that reads an HDF5 file with ASTER GED data, extracts some datasets, processes them, and then visualizes them on a map. 

First, I'll tackle the HDF5 Dataset Access part. They mentioned using h5py to access files with extensions like .h5 or .HDF5. The script needs to read specific datasets: 'Mean Emissivity for Band 10' from '/Emissivity/Mean', and also extract attributes like Description. Plus, they need geolocation data from Latitude and Longitude paths. So the sub-query should cover accessing these datasets and their metadata.

Next is NumPy-based Data Preprocessing. The user wants to replace -9999 with NaNs, scale the data by 0.001, and apply a mask using np.ma.masked_where. This part focuses on handling fill values and preprocessing the data for visualization.

Lastly, the Plotting and Visualization sub-query involves using matplotlib and Basemap. They need an equidistant cylindrical projection map with specific lat-long ranges, adding coastlines, parallels, meridians, and then plotting the data with pcolormesh. Also, a colorbar and title are required.

I'll make sure each sub-query is clear and targets only its respective domain without overlapping.
