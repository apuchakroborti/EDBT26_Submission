        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            1. Import Necessary Libraries: Include libraries for OS functions (os), plotting (matplotlib, matplotlib.pyplot), numerical operations (numpy), map projections (mpl_toolkits.basemap), and HDF5 handling.

2. Define Constants: Set `FILE_NAME` to "ATL20-01_20181101001332_05100101_004_01.h5".

3. Open HDF5 File: Access the file in read mode and extract datasets `/grid_lat`, `/grid_lon`, and `/monthly/mean_fb`.

4. Extract Attributes: From the mean_fb dataset, decode 'units' and 'long_name' using ASCII with replace errors, and retrieve '_FillValue'.

5. Data Processing:
   - Convert mean_fb data to float.
   - Replace _FillValue with NaN.
   - Mask data where values are NaN.

6. Create Map Projection: Use npstere with low resolution, boundinglat=60, lon_0=45.

7. Customize Map:
   - Add coastlines (linewidth=0.5).
   - Draw parallels at [-90, 120, 30] to be more specific from -90 to 120 with interval of 30.
   - Draw meridians at [-180, 180, 45] to be be more specific from -180 to 180 with interval of 45.

8. Adjust Longitude: 
   Before setting pcolormesh the 180 should be subtractted from longitude value and update the longitude existing value 
   Then it adds pcolormesh with parameters longitude, latitude, data, and latlon=True

9. Add Colorbar and Title:
    - Position colorbar at the bottom, labeled with dataset units.
    - Set title using file basename and 'long_name' attribute.

        Note: return only the the response of sub-queries only based on the below format, not explanation, not python code, and node additional text needed
        Return format:

Okay, so I need to break down the user's query into three specific sub-queries. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, looking at the HDF5 Dataset Access section. The user wants to open an HDF5 file and extract certain datasets and attributes. They mentioned using h5py for this. So the sub-query should focus on accessing the file with the given name, extracting '/grid_lat', '/grid_lon', and '/monthly/mean_fb'. Also, they need to get the 'units' and 'long_name' attributes from mean_fb, decoding them as ASCII, and retrieve the '_FillValue'.

Next, for NumPy-based Data Preprocessing. The user wants to convert the mean_fb data to float, replace _FillValue with NaNs, and then mask those NaN values using numpy functions like np.where or np.ma.masked_where.

Lastly, the Plotting and Visualization part involves creating a map projection using mpl_toolkits.basemap's npstere with specific parameters. They need to add coastlines, draw parallels and meridians at specified intervals, adjust the longitude by subtracting 180 before plotting, use pcolormesh for data visualization, and then add a colorbar and title based on the file name and attributes.

I'll structure each sub-query clearly, making sure they're focused on their respective domains without overlapping.

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
How to open an HDF5 file named "ATL20-01_20181101001332_05100101_004_01.h5" using h5py, access datasets '/grid_lat', '/grid_lon', and '/monthly/mean_fb', extract attributes 'units' and 'long_name' from mean_fb dataset as ASCII strings with error replacement, and retrieve the '_FillValue'.

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
How to convert a NumPy array of mean_fb data to float type, replace _FillValue entries with NaN values, and create a masked array using np.where or np.ma.masked_where where values are NaN.

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
How to create a map projection using matplotlib's Basemap toolkit with npstere projection, set boundinglat=60 and lon_0=45, add coastlines with linewidth=0.5, draw parallels at intervals of 30 degrees from -90 to 120, draw meridians at intervals of 45 degrees from -180 to 180, adjust longitude values by subtracting 180 before plotting, use pcolormesh with latlon=True for geospatial data visualization, add a colorbar at the bottom labeled with dataset units, and set the plot title using file basename and long_name attribute.
