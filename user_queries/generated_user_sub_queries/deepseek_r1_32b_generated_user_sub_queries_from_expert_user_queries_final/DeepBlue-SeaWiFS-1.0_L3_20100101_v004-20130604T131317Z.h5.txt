        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            A Python script that performs the following tasks:

1. Import necessary libraries: os, h5py, matplotlib, matplotlib.pyplot, mpl_toolkits.basemap, numpy.

2. Read data from an HDF5 file named "DeepBlue-SeaWiFS-1.0_L3_20100101_v004-20130604T131317Z.h5".

3. Extract the following datasets:
   - aerosol_optical_thickness_550_ocean
   - latitude
   - longitude

4. Retrieve attributes from the aerosol_optical_thickness_550_ocean dataset:
   - long_name
   - _FillValue

5. Decode the long_name attribute using the decode() function.

6. Replace all data points matching _FillValue with NaN values in the aerosol_optical_thickness_550_ocean dataset.

7. Create a masked array of the aerosol_optical_thickness_550_ocean data where NaN values are masked.

8. Generate a cylindrical projection map with:
   - Low resolution
   - Latitude range from -90 to 90
   - Longitude range from -180 to 180

9. Add map features:
   - Coastlines with line width 0.5
   - Parallels at latitudes at [-90, -60, -30, 0, 30, 60, 90, 120]
   - Meridians at longitudes at [-180, -135, -90, -45, 0, 45, 90, 135, 180]

10. Create a pcolormesh plot of the masked aerosol data on the map:
    - Use longitude and latitude coordinates
    - Set color scale from 0 to 1 (vmin=0, vmax=1)
    - Ensure latlon=True for geographic projection

11. Add a colorbar to the plot.

Alright, I need to break down the user's query into three specific sub-queries as per their instructions. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, looking at the HDF5 Dataset Access section. The user wants to read an HDF5 file and extract certain datasets along with attributes. They mentioned using h5py for this. So I should focus on how to access the file, retrieve the datasets like 'aerosol_optical_thickness_550_ocean', 'latitude', and 'longitude'. Also, they need to get specific attributes such as 'long_name' and '_FillValue' from that dataset. Decoding the long_name attribute is another point here.

Next, for NumPy-based Data Preprocessing, the task involves handling _FillValue by replacing it with NaNs. Then creating a masked array using those NaN values. I should make sure to mention using functions like np.where or np.ma.masked_where for this purpose.

Lastly, the Plotting and Visualization part requires generating a cylindrical projection map with matplotlib and basemap. The user specified low resolution, certain latitude and longitude ranges, adding coastlines, parallels, meridians, and then plotting the data with pcolormesh. Also, including a colorbar is essential here.

I need to ensure each sub-query is clear and targets only its specific domain without overlapping information.
