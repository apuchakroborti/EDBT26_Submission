        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            A Python script to visualize ozone (O3) data from an HDF5 file with the following specifications:

1. Import Libraries: Include os, h5py, numpy as np, matplotlib as mpl, matplotlib.pyplot as plt, and Basemap from mpl_toolkits.basemap.

2. Load Data:
   - Open the HDF5 file: 'TES-Aura_L2-O3-Nadir_r0000002433_F08_12.he5'.
   - Extract ozone data from '/HDFEOS/SWATHS/O3NadirSwath/Data Fields/O3' (all rows, 6th column).
   - Retrieve latitude and longitude from their respective paths.

3. Data Processing:
   - Extract Units, Title, and FillValue attributes from the O3 dataset.
   - Replace FillValues with NaNs in the ozone data.

4. Create Map:
   - Use Basemap with cylindrical projection, low resolution, lat limits [-90, 90], lon limits [-180, 180].
   - Draw coastlines (linewidth=0.5), parallels (every 45 degrees) from -90 to 90, 
      and meridians (every 45 degrees with labels on left and right) from -180 to 180.

5. Plot Data:
   - Scatter plot ozone data using longitude, latitude coordinates; set marker size to 1.

6. Customize Plot:
   - Add colorbar labeled with O3 Units.
   - Set title combining HDF5 filename base and O3 long_name attribute.

Alright, I need to break down the user's query into three specific sub-queries as per their instructions. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, looking at the HDF5 Dataset Access section. The user wants to open a specific HE5 file and extract ozone data from a given path, along with latitude and longitude. They also need to retrieve certain attributes like Units, Title, and FillValue. So I'll structure this sub-query to focus solely on using h5py for accessing these datasets and attributes.

Next, the NumPy-based Data Preprocessing part involves handling the _FillValue by replacing it with NaNs in the ozone data array. This is crucial before any visualization to ensure that missing or invalid data points are properly managed. I'll make sure this sub-query addresses how to apply masks using NumPy functions like np.where.

Lastly, for Map Plotting and Visualization, the user wants to use Basemap with specific projections and draw elements like coastlines, parallels, and meridians. They also need a scatter plot of ozone data with a colorbar and proper labeling. I'll focus this sub-query on the steps needed to set up the map correctly using matplotlib and Basemap.

I should ensure each sub-query is clear and targets only its specific domain without overlapping information. This way, when someone uses these sub-queries to retrieve relevant documentation or code examples, they can efficiently find what they need for each part of their task.

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
How to open an HDF5 file with extension .he5 using h5py and extract ozone data from '/HDFEOS/SWATHS/O3NadirSwath/Data Fields/O3' including latitude and longitude datasets? Also, how to retrieve Units, Title, and FillValue attributes from the O3 dataset?

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
How to replace _FillValue in a NumPy array with NaNs using np.where or np.ma.masked_where for ozone data preprocessing?

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
How to create a cylindrical projection map using Basemap with lat limits [-90, 90] and lon limits [-180, 180], draw coastlines, parallels every 45 degrees, meridians every 45 degrees with labels on left and right? Also, how to add a colorbar labeled with O3 units and set the plot title using matplotlib?
