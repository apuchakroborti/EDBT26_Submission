"""
        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            A Python script to visualize data from a GESDISC MEaSUREs GSSTF HDF-EOS5 grid file.

Steps:
1. Import necessary libraries: os, h5py, numpy as np, matplotlib as mpl, matplotlib.pyplot as plt, and mpl_toolkits.basemap import Basemap.
2. Read the HDF file located at 'GSSTF_3_2008_12_31.he5'.
3. Extract the 'E' dataset, including its attributes ('units' and 'long_name') using decode(), and retrieve the _FillValue attribute.
4. Preprocess data by replacing _FillValue with np.nan and create a masked array using np.masked_array with conditions based on np.isnan(data).
5. Construct longitude and latitude arrays based on the shape of the 'E' dataset since they are not provided in the file.
6. Create a cylindrical projection map with boundaries set for low resolution, latitudes from -90 to 90, and longitudes from -180 to 180.
7. Add parallels from -90 to 120 with interval of 30 degrees latitude with left labels only, 
    and meridians with the interval of 45 degree from -180 to 180 degrees longitude with bottom labels.
8. Visualize the data using pcolormesh with parameters longitude, latitude, data, and latlon=True.
9. Add a colorbar and a descriptive title to the plot.

        Note: return only the the response of sub-queries only based on the below format, not explanation, not python code, and node additional text needed
        Return format:

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
How can I use h5py to open a HDF-EOS5 file (e.g., with extensions .he5, .h5, .hdf5), read the dataset named 'E', retrieve its attributes 'units' and 'long_name', and obtain the '_FillValue' attribute?

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
In NumPy, how can I replace the dataset's _FillValue with np.nan, create a masked array that masks NaNs, and apply preprocessing such as computing min/max or filtering based on these masks?

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
Using matplotlib and mpl_toolkits.basemap, how can I set up a cylindrical projection map with latitude limits -90 to 90 and longitude limits -180 to 180, add parallels every 30 degrees and meridians every 45 degrees with appropriate labels, plot masked array data with pcolormesh (lon, lat, data, latlon=True), and add a colorbar and descriptive title?
