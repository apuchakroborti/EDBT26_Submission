"""
        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            A Python script that processes an HDF5 file and generates a geospatial plot as follows:

1. Load Data: Open the HDF5 file "1C.F19.SSMIS.XCAL2021-V.20160105-S214106-E232259.009078.V07A.HDF5" in read-only mode using h5py.

2. Extract Dataset: Access the `Tc` dataset from the group `S1` of hierarchical dataset, 
    which is 3D. Extract all data from the first and second dimensions at the 0th index of the third dimension. 
Retrieve attributes: 'Units', 'longname', and 'Fillvalue'.

3. Data Cleaning: Replace values matching Fillvalue with NaN in the Tc dataset.

4. Geolocation Data: Read latitude from "Latitude" and longitude from "Longitude".

5. Map Setup: Create a cylindrical projection map with low resolution, latitude range -90 to 90, and longitude range -180 to 180. 
Add coastlines (width 0.5), parallels at [-90, -45, 0, 45, 90], 
and meridians at [-180, -135, -90, -45, 0, 45, 90, 135, 180] with left and bottom labels.

6. Plot Data: Display Tc data as a scatter plot on the map using 'jet' colormap and point size 1.

7. Colorbar: Add a colorbar below the plot with 10% padding, labeled with the units from Tc's attributes.

8. Title: Set the title to include the file basename, Tc's LongName, and " (nchannel1=0)".

This structured approach ensures clarity for code generation by an LLM.

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
Open an HDF5 file with h5py in read-only mode, navigate to the group `/S1`, access the 3‑D dataset `Tc`, read its attributes `Units`, `longname`, and `Fillvalue`, and also read the `Latitude` and `Longitude` datasets from the root or appropriate groups.

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
Given a NumPy array containing the `Tc` data and a `Fillvalue`, replace all occurrences of `Fillvalue` with `np.nan`, optionally create a masked array with `np.ma.masked_where`, and compute basic statistics such as `np.nanmin`, `np.nanmax`, or filter values based on thresholds.

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
Using cartopy (or matplotlib with Basemap), set up a cylindrical (PlateCarree) projection with latitude limits -90 to 90 and longitude limits -180 to 180, add coastlines (linewidth 0.5), draw parallels at [-90, -45, 0, 45, 90] and meridians at [-180, -135, -90, -45, 0, 45, 90, 135, 180] with left and bottom labels, scatter plot the cleaned `Tc` data on the map with the 'jet' colormap and point size 1, add a colorbar below the plot with 10% padding labeled with the `Units` attribute, and set a title that includes the file basename, `longname`, and the string "(nchannel1=0)".
