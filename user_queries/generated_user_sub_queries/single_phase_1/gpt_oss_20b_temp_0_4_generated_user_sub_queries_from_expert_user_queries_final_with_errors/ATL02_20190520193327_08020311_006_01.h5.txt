"""
        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            A Python script that processes an HDF5 file and generates a split-window plot with specific visualizations.

1. Define Constants: Set `FILE_NAME` to "ATL12_20190330212241_00250301_006_03.h5".

2. Open HDF5 File: Read the file in read mode and access these datasets:
   - `latitude`, `longitude` both from /gpsr/navigation
   - `bg_cnt_50shot_s` and `delta_time` (time data) both from the sub-group path `/atlas/pce1/background`

3. Extract Attributes: For the bg_cnt_50shot_s dataset, read 'unit' and 'long name' attributes using decode('ascii', 'replace').

4. Create Plots:
   - First Plot (Time vs. Counts): 
     - Set figure size to 10x10.
     - Use subplot ax1 at position 2,1,1.
     - Calculate elapsed_time by subtracting the first time value from each time point.
     - Plot elapsed_time vs. main data with blue circles.
     - Label axes with time units and main data units.
     - Set title combining the file name, dataset name, and long name.

   - Second Plot (Trajectory Map):
     - Calculate midpoint latitude (lat_m) and longitude (lon_m).
     - Use cartopy's orthographic projection centered at lat_m and lon_m.
     - Enable gridlines with labels and degrees, minutes, seconds (dms).
     - Display global features and coastlines.
     - Plot trajectory in blue, using Geodetic transformation.
     - Mark the starting point with a red circle and label "START" offset by 200 km.

5. Adjust Layout: Use tight layout with padding of 3.0 for proper spacing.

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
How do I use h5py to open an HDF5 file (e.g., “ATL12_20190330212241_00250301_006_03.h5”), navigate to datasets such as `/gpsr/navigation/latitude`, `/gpsr/navigation/longitude`, `/atlas/pce1/background/bg_cnt_50shot_s`, and `/atlas/pce1/background/delta_time`, and read string attributes like `unit` and `long name` from the `bg_cnt_50shot_s` dataset using `decode('ascii', 'replace')`?

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
What are the best practices in NumPy for handling missing data (`_FillValue`), applying masks with `np.where` or `np.ma.masked_where`, computing elapsed time by subtracting the first element of a time array, and filtering or normalizing data (e.g., using `min`, `max`) before plotting?

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
How can I create a two‑panel figure with matplotlib and cartopy where the first panel plots elapsed time versus a count dataset with proper axis labels and title, and the second panel shows a global orthographic map centered at the trajectory midpoint, includes gridlines with DMS labels, global coastlines, plots the trajectory in blue using a geodetic transform, and marks the starting point with a red circle labeled “START” offset by 200 km?
