"""
        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            A Python code that performs the following steps:

1. Import necessary libraries
2. Define two constants:
   - FILE_NAME: Path to the input HDF5 file "OMI-Aura_L3-OMTO3e_2017m0105_v003-2017m0203t091906.he5".
   - DATAFIELD_NAME: name of the dataset "ColumnAmountO3" from the group `/HDFEOS/GRIDS/OMI Column Amount O3/Data Fields`.

3. Open the HDF5 file in read mode and access the dataset specified by DATAFIELD_NAME.

4. Read the entire dataset into memory, replacing _FillValue with NaN using numpy's isnan function to create a mask.

5. Generate synthetic geolocation data:
   - Create longitude values from -179.875 to 179.875 with 1440 points.
   - Create latitude values from -89.875 to 89.875 with 720 points.

6. Extract the 'title' and 'units' attributes from the dataset, decoding them from bytes to UTF-8 strings.

7. Use Basemap to create a cylindrical projection map:
   - Set resolution to 'low'.
   - Define latitude bounds from -90 to 90 and longitude bounds from -180 to 180.
   - Add coastlines with a line width of 0.5.
   - Draw parallels at latitudes [-90, -60, -30, 0, 30, 60, 90, 120] with labels to left.
   - Draw meridians at longitudes [-180, -135, -90, -45, 0, 0, 45, 90, 135, 180] with labels to bottom

8. Plot the data using pcolormesh:
   - Use longitude and latitude arrays for coordinates.
   - Set latlon=True and colormap to 'jet'.

9. Add a colorbar with labels set to the extracted units attribute.

        Note: return only the the response of sub-queries only based on the below format, not explanation, not python code, and node additional text needed
        Return format:

        HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
        <generated sub-query>

        NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
        <generated sub-query>

        Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
        <generated sub-query>
        """

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:  
Open the .he5 file with h5py, navigate to `/HDFEOS/GRIDS/OMI Column Amount O3/Data Fields/ColumnAmountO3`, read the dataset into a NumPy array, and extract and decode the `title` and `units` attributes from the dataset.

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:  
Replace the dataset’s `_FillValue` with `np.nan`, create a mask using `np.isnan`, and apply `np.where` or `np.ma.masked_where` to handle missing values while computing statistics such as `min` and `max`.

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:  
Use Basemap to create a cylindrical projection with low resolution, draw coastlines, parallels at [-90,-60,-30,0,30,60,90,120] with left labels, meridians at [-180,-135,-90,-45,0,45,90,135,180] with bottom labels, plot the data with `pcolormesh` using longitude and latitude arrays, and add a colorbar labeled with the extracted units.
