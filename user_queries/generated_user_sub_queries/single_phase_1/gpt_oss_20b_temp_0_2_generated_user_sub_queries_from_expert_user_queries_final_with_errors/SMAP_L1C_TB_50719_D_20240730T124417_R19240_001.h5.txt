"""
        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            I am working with an HDF5 file containing SMAP Level 1C data. 
The script should begin by importing necessary libraries

Define a constant `filename` with the value "SMAP_L1C_TB_50719_D_20240730T124417_R19240_001.h5".

The program should read this HDF5 file in read-only mode. 
Access the main dataset at "cell_tb_h_fore" and geolocation datasets at "cell_lat" (latitude) and "cell_lon" (longitude).
from the group `Global_Projection`

Extract attributes from the cell_tb_h_fore dataset: units, long_name, _FillValue, valid_max, and valid_min. 
Decode these attributes using 'ascii' encoding with 'replace' as the error handling parameter.

Identify invalid data by combining two conditions using numpy's logical_or: values greater than valid_max or less than valid_min. 
Update this mask to include values equal to _FillValue. Replace invalid data in cell_tb_h_fore with NaNs and create a masked array using numpy's masked_where function, checking for NaNs.

For visualization, initialize a Basemap object with a cylindrical projection. Set map boundaries from -90 to 90 latitude and -180 to 180 longitude. 
Add coastlines with a line width of 0.5. 
Draw parallels at intervals of 45 degrees and meridians at the same interval, labeling them at the position of left and bottom.

Create a scatter plot using longitude and latitude coordinates, with data from cell_tb_h_fore, point size 1, colormap 'jet', no edge color, and linewidth 0. 
Add a colorbar below the plot with 10% padding and label it with the units attribute.

Set the plot title to the concatenation of the filename's basename and long_name, using fontsize 7.

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
How to open an HDF5 file with h5py in read-only mode, navigate to the group `Global_Projection`, access datasets `cell_tb_h_fore`, `cell_lat`, and `cell_lon`, read their attributes (`units`, `long_name`, `_FillValue`, `valid_max`, `valid_min`), and decode these attributes using ASCII encoding with 'replace' error handling?

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
How to use NumPy to create a mask with `np.logical_or` for values greater than `valid_max` or less than `valid_min`, extend the mask to include values equal to `_FillValue`, replace invalid data in `cell_tb_h_fore` with `np.nan`, and then create a masked array with `np.ma.masked_where` that masks `np.nan` values?

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
How to set up a Basemap with a cylindrical projection covering latitudes -90 to 90 and longitudes -180 to 180, add coastlines (linewidth 0.5), draw parallels and meridians every 45 degrees with labels on the left and bottom, plot a scatter of `cell_lon` vs `cell_lat` using the masked `cell_tb_h_fore` data (size 1, cmap 'jet', no edgecolor, linewidth 0), add a colorbar below the plot with 10% padding labeled with the `units` attribute, and set the plot title to the filename basename concatenated with `long_name` using fontsize 7?
