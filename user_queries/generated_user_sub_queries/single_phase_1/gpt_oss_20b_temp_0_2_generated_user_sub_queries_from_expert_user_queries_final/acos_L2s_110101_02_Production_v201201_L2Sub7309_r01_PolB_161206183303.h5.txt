"""
        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            Create a script that performs the following steps:

1. Import necessary libraries: os, matplotlib, matplotlib.pyplot, numpy, mpl_toolkits.basemap, and h5py.

2. Define a constant FILE_NAME with the name of the HDF5 file to be processed.

3. Open the specified HDF5 file in read-only mode.

4. Extract datasets from the file:
   - `/RetrievalResults/xco2` for xCO2 data
   - `/SoundingGeometry/sounding_latitude_geoid` for latitude data
   - `/SoundingGeometry/sounding_longitude_geoid` for longitude data
   - `/SoundingGeometry/sounding_altitude` for altitude data
   - `/RetrievalHeader/sounding_time_tai93` for time data

5. Retrieve the 'Units' attribute from both xco2 and altitude datasets at index 0.

6. Create a figure with two subplots:
   - First subplot: Orthographic projection map with low resolution, centered at lat_0 = -55 and lon_0 = 120, 
   displaying the sounding trajectory using latitude and longitude coordinates.
   - Second subplot: Line plot showing time vs xco2 data, with a twin axis for time vs altitude data.

7. Customize the map by adding:
   - Coastlines with a line width of 0.5
   - Parallels at latitudes [-80, -60, -40, -20, 0]
   - Meridians at longitudes from -180 to 180 with interval of 20

8. Customize both plots by setting appropriate axis labels, titles, and tick formats.

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
How do I use h5py to open an HDF5 file (with extensions .h5, .hdf5, .HE5, etc.) in read‑only mode, access datasets by absolute path (e.g., `/RetrievalResults/xco2`, `/SoundingGeometry/sounding_latitude_geoid`), read their data into NumPy arrays, and retrieve a specific attribute (such as the 'Units' attribute) from a dataset at a given index (e.g., index 0)?

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
What are the best practices for handling `_FillValue` in NumPy arrays obtained from HDF5 datasets, including applying masks with `np.where` or `np.ma.masked_where`, filtering data based on conditions, and computing statistics like `min` and `max` while ignoring masked or fill values?

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
How can I create a Matplotlib figure with two subplots where the first uses `mpl_toolkits.basemap` to display an orthographic map (low resolution, centered at lat_0 = -55, lon_0 = 120) with coastlines (linewidth 0.5), specified parallels and meridians, and plot a sounding trajectory from latitude and longitude arrays; and the second subplot shows a line plot of time vs xCO₂ with a twin y‑axis for time vs altitude, including proper axis labels, titles, and tick formatting?
