"""
        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            A Python script to visualize ozone (O3) data from an HDF5 file with the following specifications:

1. Import Libraries: Include os, h5py, numpy as np, matplotlib as mpl, matplotlib.pyplot as plt, and Basemap from mpl_toolkits.basemap.

2. Load Data:
   - Open the HDF5 file: 'TES-Aura_L2-O3-Nadir_r0000002433_F08_12.he5'.
   - Extract ozone data from '/HDFEOS/SWATHS/O3NadirSwath/Data Fields/O3' (all rows, 6th column).
   - Retrieve latitude and longitude from their respective paths.

3. Data Processing:
   - Extract Units, Title, and FillValue attributes from the O3 dataset.
   - Replace FillValues with NaNs in the ozone data.

4. Create Map:
   - Use Basemap with cylindrical projection, low resolution, lat limits [-90, 90], lon limits [-180, 180].
   - Draw coastlines (linewidth=0.5), parallels (every 45 degrees) from -90 to 90, 
      and meridians (every 45 degrees with labels on left and right) from -180 to 180.

5. Plot Data:
   - Scatter plot ozone data using longitude, latitude coordinates; set marker size to 1.

6. Customize Plot:
   - Add colorbar labeled with O3 Units.
   - Set title combining HDF5 filename base and O3 long_name attribute.

        Note: return only the the response of sub-queries only based on the below format, not explanation, not python code, and node additional text needed
        Return format:

        HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
        <generated sub-query>

        NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
        <generated sub-query>

        Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
        <generated sub-query>
        """

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
Using h5py, open the file 'TES-Aura_L2-O3-Nadir_r0000002433_F08_12.he5', access the ozone dataset at '/HDFEOS/SWATHS/O3NadirSwath/Data Fields/O3', retrieve its attributes 'Units', 'Title', and '_FillValue', and also read the latitude and longitude datasets from their respective paths within the file.

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
Replace the ozone array's _FillValue with np.nan using np.where or np.ma.masked_where, then compute min and max values of the cleaned data and optionally filter out NaNs for further analysis.

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
Create a Basemap with cylindrical projection (low resolution, lat [-90,90], lon [-180,180]), draw coastlines (linewidth=0.5), parallels every 45°, meridians every 45° with left/right labels, scatter plot the ozone data with marker size 1, add a colorbar labeled with the O3 Units, and set the plot title to the file base name plus the O3 long_name attribute.
