"""
        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            A Python script that reads and visualizes data from an HDF5 file with the following steps:

1. Import Libraries: Include os, h5py, matplotlib, matplotlib.pyplot, mpl_toolkits.basemap, and numpy.

2. Read HDF5 File: Open the file located at "DeepBlue-SeaWiFS_L2_20101210T135954Z_v004-20130525T172725Z.h5".

3. Access Dataset: Extract the dataset named `aerosol_optical_thickness_550_ocean`.

4. Extract Metadata: Retrieve the long_name and units from the aerosol_optical_thickness_550_ocean dataset, decoding them using decode().

5. Preprocess Data:
   - Replace -999 values with NaN.
   - Create a masked array using numpy's masked_array function, masking where data is NaN.

6. Set Up Visualization:
   - Use an orthographic map projection with mean latitude and longitude.
   - Add coastlines with 0.5 width.
   - Draw parallels at -90° to 120 with interval 30°; meridians at -180° to 180°, and 45° intervals.

7. Create Pseudocolor Plot: Use matplotlib's pcmesh with latlon=True, plotting longitude, latitude, and aerosol data.

8. Customize Plot:
   - Add a colorbar labeled with the dataset's units.
   - Set the title using the filename and long_name of the dataset.

        Note: return only the the response of sub-queries only based on the below format, not explanation, not python code, and node additional text needed

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
How to open an HDF5 file with h5py, access the dataset named `aerosol_optical_thickness_550_ocean`, read its data array, and retrieve the attributes `long_name` and `units`, decoding them using `decode()`?

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
How to replace all occurrences of the sentinel value `-999` in a NumPy array with `np.nan`, then create a masked array that masks the `np.nan` values using `np.ma.masked_where`?

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
How to plot the aerosol optical thickness data on an orthographic map projection centered at the mean latitude and longitude, add coastlines (width 0.5), draw parallels from -90° to 120° with 30° intervals and meridians from -180° to 180° with 45° intervals, create a pseudocolor plot with `pcolormesh` (latlon=True), add a colorbar labeled with the dataset units, and set a title combining the filename and the dataset long_name?
