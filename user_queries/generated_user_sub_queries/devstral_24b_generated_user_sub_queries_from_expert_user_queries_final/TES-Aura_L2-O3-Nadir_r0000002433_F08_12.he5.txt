"""
        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
        A Python script to visualize ozone (O3) data from an HDF5 file with the following specifications:

1. Import Libraries: Include os, h5py, numpy as np, matplotlib as mpl, matplotlib.pyplot as plt, and Basemap from mpl_toolkits.basemap.

2. Load Data:
   - Open the HDF5 file: 'TES-Aura_L2-O3-Nadir_r0000002433_F08_12.he5'.
   - Extract ozone data from '/HDFEOS/SWATHS/O3NadirSwath/Data Fields/O3' (all rows, 6th column).
   - Retrieve latitude and longitude from their respective paths.

3. Data Processing:
   - Extract Units, Title, and FillValue attributes from the O3 dataset.
   - Replace FillValues with NaNs in the ozone data.

4. Create Map:
   - Use Basemap with cylindrical projection, low resolution, lat limits [-90, 90], lon limits [-180, 180].
   - Draw coastlines (linewidth=0.5), parallels (every 45 degrees) from -90 to 90, 
      and meridians (every 45 degrees with labels on left and right) from -180 to 180.

5. Plot Data:
   - Scatter plot ozone data using longitude, latitude coordinates; set marker size to 1.

6. Customize Plot:
   - Add colorbar labeled with O3 Units.
   - Set title combining HDF5 filename base and O3 long_name attribute.

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
How to use h5py to open an HDF5 file with extension .he5, extract datasets from specific paths like '/HDFEOS/SWATHS/O3NadirSwath/Data Fields/O3', and retrieve latitude and longitude data.

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
How to handle _FillValue in NumPy arrays, replace FillValues with NaNs, and process attributes such as Units, Title, and long_name from HDF5 datasets.

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
How to use Basemap from mpl_toolkits.basemap for cylindrical projection maps, draw coastlines, parallels, meridians, create scatter plots of geospatial data, add colorbars, and customize plot titles.
