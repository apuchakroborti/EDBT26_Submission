"""
        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
        A Python code to read and visualize data from an HDF-EOS5 file located at HIRDLS-Aura_L2_v07-00-20-c01_2008d077.he5.

The code should:
1. Import necessary libraries: os, datetime, h5py, numpy as np, FormatStrFormatter and ScalarFormatter from matplotlib.ticker, matplotlib as mpl, matplotlib.pyplot as plt, and Basemap from mpl_toolkits.basemap.

2. Read three datasets:
   - O3 data from /HDFEOS/SWATHS/HIRDLS/Data Fields/O3 (extract 0th index along x-axis and all y-axis data)
   - Pressure data from /HDFEOS/SWATHS/HIRDLS/Geolocation Fields/Pressure
   - Time data from /HDFEOS/SWATHS/HIRDLS/Geolocation Fields/Time (only 0th index)

3. Read attributes:
   - Units from O3 and Pressure datasets
   - Title from O3, Time, and Pressure datasets
   - _FillValue from O3 dataset

4. Decode attribute values using decode().

5. Replace O3 data with NaN where it matches _FillValue.

6. Create datestr variable by initializing a datetime object at 1993-01-01 and adding seconds from the Time dataset.

7. Generate a plot of O3 vs Pressure:
   - Customize x-axis with scientific notation
   - Set y-axis to log scale and invert it
   - Format axis labels using dataset Titles and Units
   - Set title combining filename, O3 Title, and Units

8. At the end, the gca of the plot is set such as invert yaxis, yscale value of log, and major formatter is FormatStrFormatter with the value of '%g'. Display the plot.

        Note: return only the the response of sub-queries only based on the below format, not explanation, not python code, and node additional text needed
        Return format:

        HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
        <generated sub-query>

        NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
        <generated sub-query>

        Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
        <generated sub-query>
        """

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
How to open and read specific datasets (O3, Pressure, Time) and attributes (Units, Title, _FillValue) from an HDF5 file using `h5py`, including accessing data by index (e.g., `[0]`) and retrieving attribute values using `.attrs`. Also, how to decode attribute values using `.decode()`.

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
How to replace values in a NumPy array with NaN based on a `_FillValue`, and how to perform basic array manipulation like indexing and data extraction.

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
How to create a plot using `matplotlib` with a logarithmic y-axis, inverted y-axis, scientific notation on the x-axis, custom axis labels and titles, and how to configure the major formatter for the y-axis using `FormatStrFormatter`. Also, how to set the plot title and axis labels using strings and variables.
