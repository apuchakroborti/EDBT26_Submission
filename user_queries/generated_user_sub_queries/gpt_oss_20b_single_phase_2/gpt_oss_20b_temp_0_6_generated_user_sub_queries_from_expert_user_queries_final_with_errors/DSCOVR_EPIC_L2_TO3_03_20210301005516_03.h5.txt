"""
        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            A Python script that accesses and visualizes ozone data from a NASA HDF-EOS file named `DSCOVR_EPIC_L2_TO3_03_20210301005516_03.h5`. 
The script should perform the following steps:

1. Open the HDF5 file in read-only mode and extract the following datasets:
   - `/Ozone` for ozone data
   - `/Latitude` for latitude coordinates
   - `/Longitude` for longitude coordinates

2. Set attributes such as `units` (expected value: 'DU') and `long_name` (expected value: 'Ozone').

3. Process the ozone data by replacing the static fill value (-999.0) with NaN values using numpy's masked_where function, based on whether the ozone data is not a number.

4. Calculate the midpoint of the latitude and longitude arrays to determine the center point for visualization.

5. Create an orthographic projection map centered at the calculated midpoint using Cartopy's Orthographic class.

6. Plot the ozone data as a scatter plot with parameters:
   - Longitude as x-coordinates
   - Latitude as y-coordinates
   - Ozone values represented by color (using cmap=plt.cm.jet)
   - Marker size of 1
   - Data transformation set to PlateCarree coordinates

7. Add map features including gridlines, coastlines, and degree labels for latitude and longitude.

8. Create a colorbar with a width of 0.022 and padding of 0.01.

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
How do I use `h5py` to open an HDF5 file (e.g., `DSCOVR_EPIC_L2_TO3_03_20210301005516_03.h5`), read the datasets `/Ozone`, `/Latitude`, and `/Longitude`, and set or read attributes such as `units` and `long_name` on those datasets?

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
What is the recommended way in NumPy to replace a static fill value (e.g., `-999.0`) in an array with `np.nan` and then create a masked array using `np.ma.masked_where` based on `np.isnan`?

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
In matplotlib with cartopy, how can I create an orthographic projection centered at a computed midpoint latitude/longitude, plot a scatter of ozone data with PlateCarree coordinates, add coastlines, gridlines with degree labels, and attach a colorbar with a width of 0.022 and padding of 0.01?
