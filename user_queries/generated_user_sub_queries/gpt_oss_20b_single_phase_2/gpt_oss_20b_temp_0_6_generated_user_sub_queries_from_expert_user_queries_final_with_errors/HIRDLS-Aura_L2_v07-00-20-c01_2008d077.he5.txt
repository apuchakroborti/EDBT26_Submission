"""
        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            A Python code to read and visualize data from an HDF-EOS5 file located at HIRDLS-Aura_L2_v07-00-20-c01_2008d077.he5.

The code should:
1. Read three datasets:
   - O3 data from `O3` (extract 0th index along x-axis and all y-axis data) from the group `/HDFEOS/SWATHS/HIRDLS/Data Fields`
   - Pressure data from `Pressure`, Time data from `Time` (only 0th index) from the group `/HDFEOS/SWATHS/HIRDLS/Geolocation Fields`

2. Read attributes:
   - units from O3 and Pressure datasets
   - title from O3, Time, and Pressure datasets
   - fillValue from O3 dataset

3. Decode attribute values using decode().

4. Replace O3 data with NaN where it matches _FillValue.

5. Create datestr variable by initializing a datetime object at 1993-01-01 and adding seconds from the Time dataset.

6. Generate a plot of O3 vs Pressure:
   - Customize x-axis with scientific notation
   - Set y-axis to log scale and invert it
   - Format axis labels using dataset Titles and Units
   - Set title combining filename, O3 Title, and Units

7. At the end, the gca of the plot is set such as invert yaxis, yscale value of log, and major formatter is FormatStrFormatter with the value of '%g'. Display the plot.

        Note: return only the the response of sub-queries only based on the below format, not explanation, not python code, and node additional text needed
        Return format:

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
How can I use h5py to open an HDF‑EOS5 .he5 file, navigate to the group `/HDFEOS/SWATHS/HIRDLS/Data Fields` to read the `O3` dataset (extracting the first index along the x‑axis), navigate to `/HDFEOS/SWATHS/HIRDLS/Geolocation Fields` to read the `Pressure` dataset and the first index of the `Time` dataset, and then retrieve the attributes `units`, `title`, and `_FillValue` from these datasets, decoding any byte‑string attributes with `decode()`?

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
What is the best way to replace values in a NumPy array that equal a given `_FillValue` with `np.nan`, create a datetime array by adding the seconds from a `Time` array to a base datetime (e.g., 1993‑01‑01), and apply masking or filtering using `np.where` or `np.ma.masked_where` to handle missing data before plotting?

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
How do I plot `O3` versus `Pressure` using matplotlib, set the x‑axis to scientific notation, set the y‑axis to a log scale and invert it, format the axis labels with the datasets' titles and units, set a combined title of the filename, O3 title, and units, and configure the current axes to invert the y‑axis, set the y‑scale to log, and use `FormatStrFormatter('%g')` for the major tick formatter?
