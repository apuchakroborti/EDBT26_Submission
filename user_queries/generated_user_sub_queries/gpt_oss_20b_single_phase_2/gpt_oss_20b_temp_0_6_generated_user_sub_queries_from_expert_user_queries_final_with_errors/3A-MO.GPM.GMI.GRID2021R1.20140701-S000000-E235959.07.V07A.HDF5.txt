"""
        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            1. Define HDF5 File Constant: Create a constant for the HDF5 file name to be read.

2. Read Data from HDF5:
   - Open the specified HDF5 file.
   - Access the 'cloud Water' dataset
   - Extract the 0th slice along the x-axis, retaining all y and z data.
   - Retrieve the units of the dataset.

3. Data Processing:
   - Replace `fillvalue` with NaN using numpy's `where` function based on the 'cloudWater' data.
   - Apply a mask to the cloudWater data where values are NaN using numpy's `ma.masked_where`.

4. Create Geolocation Data:
   - Manually construct longitude and latitude arrays since geolocation data is absent in the HDF5 file.
   - Longitude array: 1440 values from -179.875 to 179.875.
   - Latitude array: 720 values from -89.875 to 89.875.

5. Set Up Map Visualization:
   - Initialize a map object with cylindrical projection and low resolution.
   - Set latitude limits from -90 to 90 and longitude limits from -180 to 180.

6. Draw Map Elements:
   - Add coastlines with a line width of 0.5.
   - Draw parallels at latitudes [-90, -45, 0, 45, 90] and meridians at longitudes [-180, -135, -90, -45, 0, 45, 90, 135, 180], spaced every 45 degrees.
   - Label the parallels and meridians appropriately to the left and bottom

7. Finalize Visualization:
   - Add a colorbar with a label set to the dataset's units.
   - Set the plot title using the HDF5 file name and dataset name without slashes.

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
Open HDF5 file with h5py, access dataset '/Grid/cloudWater', read 0th slice along the x‑axis, retrieve the dataset’s units attribute, and handle common extensions (H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, hdf5).

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
Replace the dataset’s _FillValue with NaN using np.where, apply np.ma.masked_where to mask NaNs in the cloudWater array, and compute min/max values after masking.

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
Plot the masked cloudWater slice on a cylindrical projection using matplotlib/cartopy, set latitude limits -90 to 90 and longitude limits -180 to 180, draw coastlines (linewidth 0.5), add parallels at [-90, -45, 0, 45, 90] and meridians at [-180, -135, -90, -45, 0, 45, 90, 135, 180] with labels on the left/bottom, include a colorbar labeled with the dataset units, and set the title to the HDF5 file name and dataset name (without slashes).
