"""
        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            A Python script that performs the following tasks:

1. Read HDF5 File: Open the file `MLS-Aura_L2GP-H2O_v04-20-c01_2013d003.he5` using `h5py`.

3. Access Datasets:
   - Extract data from `L2gpValue` from the group `/HDFEOS/SWATHS/H2O/Data Fields`, focusing on the x-axis and y=0 index of the 2D array.
   - Retrieve pressure values from `/HDFEOS/SWATHS/H2O/Geolocation Fields/Pressure`.
   - Obtain attributes: `Units` from both datasets and `Title` from the Pressure dataset.

4. Extract Geolocation Data:
   - Fetch latitude data from `Latitude`, longitude data from `Longitude` from the group `/HDFEOS/SWATHS/H2O/Geolocation Fields`

5. Visualization Setup:
   - Create a cylindrical projection map with low resolution, setting latitude from -90 to 90 and longitude from -180 to 180.
   - Add coastlines with a linewidth of 0.5.
   - Draw parallels at latitudes from -90 to 90 with the interval of 45.
   - Draw meridians similarly with spacing of 45 degree, starting at -180 till 180, and apply left and bottom labels

6. Scatter Plot:
   - Use `plt.scatter` with longitude and latitude coordinates, data from L2gpValue, markersize 1, colormap 'jet', no edge colors, and linewidth 0.

7. Colorbar and Labels:
   - Add a colorbar at the bottom with format "%.1e" and 10% padding.
   - Set the colorbar label using the `Units` attribute from L2gpValue.

        Return format:

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
How do I use h5py to open an HDF5 file with extensions .he5, access the dataset `/HDFEOS/SWATHS/H2O/Data Fields/L2gpValue`, retrieve its `Units` attribute, and extract the first row (y=0) of the 2‑D array? Additionally, how can I read the `Pressure` dataset at `/HDFEOS/SWATHS/H2O/Geolocation Fields/Pressure`, obtain its `Units` attribute and its `Title` attribute, and fetch latitude and longitude arrays from `/HDFEOS/SWATHS/H2O/Geolocation Fields/Latitude` and `/HDFEOS/SWATHS/H2O/Geolocation Fields/Longitude`?

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
What is the best practice to handle `_FillValue` in a NumPy array (e.g., the L2gpValue data), create a masked array using `np.ma.masked_where`, and compute the minimum and maximum of the unmasked data for preprocessing before plotting?

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
How can I set up a cylindrical (Plate Carree) map projection with matplotlib and cartopy, configure latitude limits from -90 to 90 and longitude limits from -180 to 180, add coastlines with linewidth 0.5, draw parallels every 45° and meridians every 45° with left and bottom labels, scatter plot longitude/latitude points with a `jet` colormap and markersize 1, and add a bottom colorbar formatted as "%.1e" with 10% padding and a label using the `Units` attribute from the L2gpValue dataset?
