"""
        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            A script to visualize precipitation rate data from an HDF5 file by following these steps:

1. Open HDF5 File: Access the hierarchical data file in read-only mode and extract the `precipRateESurface` dataset from the sub-group `/FS/SLV`
    along with its `unit` and `FillValu` attribute.

2. Handle Missing Data: Replace `FillValu` entries with NaNs using numpy's masked_where function to mask the data where values are NaN.

3. Retrieve Geolocation Data: Extract latitude from `Latitude` and longitude from `Longitude` from the root group `FS`.

4. Set Up Map Projection: Create a cylindrical projection with low resolution, spanning latitudes from -90 to 90 and longitudes from -180 to 180.

5. Customize Map: Add coastlines (width 0.5), parallels at [-90, -45, 0, 45, 90], and meridians at [-180, -135, -90, -45, 0, 45, 90, 135, 180] with left and bottom labels.

6. Plot Data: Use a scatter plot with the 'jet' colormap, point size of 1, based on longitude and latitude coordinates.

7. Add Colorbar and Title: Include a colorbar below the plot, labeled with the dataset's units, and set the title to reflect the file and dataset name.

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
How do I open an HDF5 file with h5py, read the dataset `/FS/SLV/precipRateESurface` and its attributes `unit` and `FillValu`, and also extract the `/FS/Latitude` and `/FS/Longitude` datasets?

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
How can I replace the `FillValu` entries in a NumPy array with NaN, mask them using `np.ma.masked_where`, and then compute or filter the data using `min`, `max`, or other preprocessing logic?

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
Using matplotlib and cartopy, how do I set up a cylindrical PlateCarree projection, plot a scatter of precipitation data with the 'jet' colormap and point size 1, add coastlines, parallels at [-90, -45, 0, 45, 90], meridians at [-180, -135, -90, -45, 0, 45, 90, 135, 180] with labels, and include a colorbar below the plot labeled with the dataset's units and a title that references the file and dataset name?
