"""
        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            A Python code to read and visualize data from an HDF-EOS5 file located at HIRDLS-Aura_L2_v07-00-20-c01_2008d077.he5.

The code should:
1. Read three datasets:
   - O3 data from `O3` (extract 0th index along x-axis and all y-axis data) from the group `/HDFEOS/SWATHS/HIRDLS/Data Fields`
   - Pressure data from `Pressure`, Time data from `Time` (only 0th index) from the group `/HDFEOS/SWATHS/HIRDLS/Geolocation Fields`

2. Read attributes:
   - units from O3 and Pressure datasets
   - title from O3, Time, and Pressure datasets
   - fillValue from O3 dataset

3. Decode attribute values using decode().

4. Replace O3 data with NaN where it matches _FillValue.

5. Create datestr variable by initializing a datetime object at 1993-01-01 and adding seconds from the Time dataset.

6. Generate a plot of O3 vs Pressure:
   - Customize x-axis with scientific notation
   - Set y-axis to log scale and invert it
   - Format axis labels using dataset Titles and Units
   - Set title combining filename, O3 Title, and Units

7. At the end, the gca of the plot is set such as invert yaxis, yscale value of log, and major formatter is FormatStrFormatter with the value of '%g'. Display the plot.

        Note: return only the the response of sub-queries only based on the below format, not explanation, not python code, and node additional text needed

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
How do I use h5py to open an HDF-EOS5 file with a .he5 extension, navigate to `/HDFEOS/SWATHS/HIRDLS/Data Fields` and read the `O3` dataset, extracting the 0th index along the x‑axis and all y‑axis data, then read its `units`, `title`, and `_FillValue` attributes? Additionally, how do I navigate to `/HDFEOS/SWATHS/HIRDLS/Geolocation Fields` to read the `Pressure` and `Time` datasets, extract the 0th index from each, and read their `units` and `title` attributes, decoding the attribute values with `.decode()`?

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
How can I use NumPy to replace all occurrences of a dataset’s `_FillValue` in an array with `np.nan`, apply masking with `np.where` or `np.ma.masked_where`, convert an array of time offsets (seconds) to datetime strings by adding them to a base datetime (`datetime(1993,1,1)`), and compute min/max or apply other preprocessing logic on the resulting arrays?

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
How do I create a Matplotlib plot of O3 versus Pressure where the x‑axis uses scientific notation, the y‑axis is on a log scale and inverted, axis labels incorporate dataset titles and units, the plot title combines the filename and dataset information, and the current Axes (`gca`) is configured with `invert_yaxis()`, `yscale('log')`, and a `FormatStrFormatter('%g')` for major ticks, finally displaying the plot?
