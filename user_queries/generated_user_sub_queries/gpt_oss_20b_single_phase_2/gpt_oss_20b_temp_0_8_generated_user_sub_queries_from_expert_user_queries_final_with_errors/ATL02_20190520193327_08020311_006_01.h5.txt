"""
        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            A Python script that processes an HDF5 file and generates a split-window plot with specific visualizations.

1. Define Constants: Set `FILE_NAME` to "ATL12_20190330212241_00250301_006_03.h5".

2. Open HDF5 File: Read the file in read mode and access these datasets:
   - `latitude`, `longitude` both from /gpsr/navigation
   - `bg_cnt_50shot_s` and `delta_time` (time data) both from the sub-group path `/atlas/pce1/background`

3. Extract Attributes: For the bg_cnt_50shot_s dataset, read 'unit' and 'long name' attributes using decode('ascii', 'replace').

4. Create Plots:
   - First Plot (Time vs. Counts): 
     - Set figure size to 10x10.
     - Use subplot ax1 at position 2,1,1.
     - Calculate elapsed_time by subtracting the first time value from each time point.
     - Plot elapsed_time vs. main data with blue circles.
     - Label axes with time units and main data units.
     - Set title combining the file name, dataset name, and long name.

   - Second Plot (Trajectory Map):
     - Calculate midpoint latitude (lat_m) and longitude (lon_m).
     - Use cartopy's orthographic projection centered at lat_m and lon_m.
     - Enable gridlines with labels and degrees, minutes, seconds (dms).
     - Display global features and coastlines.
     - Plot trajectory in blue, using Geodetic transformation.
     - Mark the starting point with a red circle and label "START" offset by 200 km.

5. Adjust Layout: Use tight layout with padding of 3.0 for proper spacing.

        Note: return only the the response of sub-queries only based on the below format, not explanation, not python code, and node additional text needed
        Return format:

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
Open the file “ATL12_20190330212241_00250301_006_03.h5” with h5py, read the datasets `/gpsr/navigation/latitude`, `/gpsr/navigation/longitude`, `/atlas/pce1/background/bg_cnt_50shot_s`, `/atlas/pce1/background/delta_time`, and extract the attributes `unit` and `long name` from `bg_cnt_50shot_s`, decoding the attribute strings with `decode('ascii', 'replace')`.

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
Using NumPy, compute `elapsed_time` by subtracting the first element of the `delta_time` array from all time values, handle any `_FillValue` in `bg_cnt_50shot_s` by masking or replacing with `np.nan`, and then determine the minimum and maximum of the masked `bg_cnt_50shot_s` data for plotting.

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
With matplotlib and cartopy, create a figure size 10x10 containing two subplots: (1) a time‑vs‑counts plot (blue circles) with appropriate axis labels, units, and a title combining file name, dataset name, and long name; (2) a trajectory map using an orthographic projection centered at the mean latitude/longitude, gridlines with DMS labels, global coastlines, a blue trajectory plotted with a Geodetic transform, a red start marker offset 200 km, and finally apply `tight_layout(pad=3.0)` for spacing.
