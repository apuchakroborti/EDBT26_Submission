"""
        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            A Python script that reads ozone data from an HDF5 file and generates a visualization.

1. Import Libraries: Include datetime, os, matplotlib, matplotlib.pyplot, mpl_toolkits.basemap, numpy, and h5py.

2. Read HDF5 File: Open the specified HDF5 file using h5py to access its contents.

3. Extract Datasets:
   - Retrieve the 3D ProfileOzone data from /Data_Fields/ProfileOzone.
   - Extract Latitude data from /Data_Fields/Latitude.
   - Obtain ProfilePressureLevels from /Data_Fields/ProfilePressureLevels.
   - Fetch Date data from /Data_Fields/Date.

4. Extract Attributes: From the ProfileOzone, Latitude, and ProfilePressureLevels datasets, extract the 'units' and 'long_name' attributes for labeling purposes.

5. Data Processing:
   - Slice ProfileOzone to get the 0th index along the x-axis (ProfileOzone[0, :, :]).
   - Extract the 0th index from Date data.
   - Replace _FillValue in ProfileOzone with NaN using numpy's masked_where function.

6. Transform Pressure Levels: Apply log10 transformation to ProfilePressureLevels.

7. Create Visualization:
   - Use contourf to plot latitude vs. transformed pressure levels with ozone data.
   - Add a colorbar labeled with ozone units.
   - Set x-axis label to Latitude's long name and units.
   - Set y-axis label to a combination of Pressure Levels' long name and units.
   - Set the title to include the HDF5 filename and ProfileOzone's long name.

8. Display Plot: Render the plot using matplotlib's show function.

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
How to use h5py to open an HDF5 file (extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, hdf5), access datasets /Data_Fields/ProfileOzone, /Data_Fields/Latitude, /Data_Fields/ProfilePressureLevels, /Data_Fields/Date, and read their 'units' and 'long_name' attributes?

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
How to slice a 3D NumPy array to get the first index along the first axis, replace _FillValue with NaN using np.ma.masked_where, and apply np.log10 to a 1D array of pressure levels?

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
Using matplotlib (and optionally mpl_toolkits.basemap or cartopy), how to create a contourf plot of latitude vs. log10‑transformed pressure levels with ozone data, add a colorbar labeled with ozone units, set x‑axis label from Latitude long_name and units, y‑axis label from PressureLevels long_name and units, and set a title that includes the HDF5 filename and ProfileOzone long_name?
