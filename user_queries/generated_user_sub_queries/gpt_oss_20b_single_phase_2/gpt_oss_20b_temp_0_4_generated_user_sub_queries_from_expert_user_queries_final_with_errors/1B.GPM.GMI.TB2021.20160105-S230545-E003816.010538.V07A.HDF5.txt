"""
        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            A Python script that performs the following steps:

1. Open an HDF5 file in read mode using h5py and extract the dataset 'Tb' from the group `S1`, 
including its 'unit' and 'fillValue' attributes. Also, retrieve geolocation data from 'Latitude' and 'Longitude'.

2. Mask NaN values in the 'Tb' dataset using numpy's masked_where function with parameters based on numpy's isnan.

3. Create a cylindrical projection map with specific settings (low resolution, -90 to 90 latitude range, -180 to 180 longitude range etc.). 
it also adds coastlines with width 0.5, parrallels with every 45 degree from -90 to 90 degree.
After that it also add meridians to every 45 degree from -180 to 180 with left and bottom labels 

4. Plot the dataset as a scatter plot on the map using the 'jet' colormap, setting each point's size to 1.

5. Add a colorbar below the plot with padding of 10% and label it using the units extracted from the 'Tb' dataset.

6. Set the plot title by combining the HDF5 file's basename, the string "Tb", and "(nchan1=0)".

        Note: return only the the response of sub-queries only based on the below format, not explanation, not python code, and node additional text needed

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
How do I open an HDF5 file with h5py, access the dataset 'Tb' inside the group 'S1', read its 'unit' and 'fillValue' attributes, and also retrieve the 'Latitude' and 'Longitude' datasets from the file?

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
What is the recommended way to mask NaN values and a custom _FillValue in a NumPy array using np.ma.masked_where and np.isnan, and then compute the minimum and maximum of the masked array?

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
How can I create a cylindrical projection map with cartopy (or mpl_toolkits.basemap), add coastlines, parallels every 45°, meridians every 45° with labels, plot a scatter of geospatial data using the 'jet' colormap and point size 1, add a colorbar below the plot with 10% padding and a unit label, and set a title combining a filename, "Tb", and "(nchan1=0)"?
