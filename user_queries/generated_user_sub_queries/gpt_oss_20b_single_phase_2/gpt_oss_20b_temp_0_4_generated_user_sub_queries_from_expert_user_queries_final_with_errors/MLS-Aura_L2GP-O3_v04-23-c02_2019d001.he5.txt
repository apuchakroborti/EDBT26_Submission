"""
        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            A Python script that performs the following tasks:

1. Open an HE5 file named "MLS-Aura_L2GP-O3_v04-23-c02_2019d001.he5" in read mode.

2. Access the following datasets within the file:
   - Ozone data: "/HDFEOS/SWATHS/O3/Data Fields/L2gpValue"
   - Latitude values: "Latitude", Pressure levels: "Pressure", Time information: "Time" from the group `/HDFEOS/SWATHS/O3/Geolocation Fields`

3. Read ozone data from index 0 to 70 along the x-axis and all y-axis data.
4. Read latitude data from index 0 to 70.
5. Read pressure data up to index 55.
6. Extract units and title information from the ozone, latitude, and longitude datasets and also and decods the value.

7. Preprocess the data:
   - Replace _FillValue with numpy NaN.
   - Mask ozone data using masked_array where values are NaN.

8. Calculate start and end times using datetime functions relative to "1993-01-01" plus time in seconds from index 0 and 70, respectively, and format these as strings.

9. Create a pcolormesh plot with parameters: latitude, longitude, and ozone data transposed (data.T).

10. Set x-axis label using latitude title and units, and y-axis label using longitude title and units.

11. Set the plot title to include the data title concatenated with start and end times.

12. Configure the plot:
    - sets gca to plt
    - Invert the y-axis.
    - Set y-scale to log.
    - Format major ticks to display values with one decimal place.

13. Save the plot at the location of the data file and Display the plot.

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
How do I use h5py to open an HE5 file, navigate to datasets such as `/HDFEOS/SWATHS/O3/Data Fields/L2gpValue`, read slices (e.g., all y‑axis and x‑axis indices 0–70), and retrieve attributes like `units` and `title` from datasets `Latitude`, `Pressure`, and `Time` located in the group `/HDFEOS/SWATHS/O3/Geolocation Fields`?

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
What is the correct approach to replace a dataset’s `_FillValue` with `np.nan`, create a masked array that masks NaN ozone values, and then compute or filter the data (e.g., using `np.min`, `np.max`, or `np.ma.masked_where`) in NumPy?

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
How can I create a `pcolormesh` plot with latitude and longitude axes, transpose the ozone data, set axis labels using the datasets’ titles and units, compose a title that includes start and end times, invert the y‑axis, set a logarithmic y‑scale, format major ticks to one decimal place, and finally save and display the figure with matplotlib (or cartopy)?
