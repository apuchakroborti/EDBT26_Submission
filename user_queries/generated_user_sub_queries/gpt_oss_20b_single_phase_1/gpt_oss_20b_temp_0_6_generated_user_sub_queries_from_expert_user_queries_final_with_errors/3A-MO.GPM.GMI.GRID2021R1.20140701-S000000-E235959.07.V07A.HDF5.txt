"""
        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            1. Define HDF5 File Constant: Create a constant for the HDF5 file name to be read.

2. Read Data from HDF5:
   - Open the specified HDF5 file.
   - Access the 'cloud Water' dataset
   - Extract the 0th slice along the x-axis, retaining all y and z data.
   - Retrieve the units of the dataset.

3. Data Processing:
   - Replace `fillvalue` with NaN using numpy's `where` function based on the 'cloudWater' data.
   - Apply a mask to the cloudWater data where values are NaN using numpy's `ma.masked_where`.

4. Create Geolocation Data:
   - Manually construct longitude and latitude arrays since geolocation data is absent in the HDF5 file.
   - Longitude array: 1440 values from -179.875 to 179.875.
   - Latitude array: 720 values from -89.875 to 89.875.

5. Set Up Map Visualization:
   - Initialize a map object with cylindrical projection and low resolution.
   - Set latitude limits from -90 to 90 and longitude limits from -180 to 180.

6. Draw Map Elements:
   - Add coastlines with a line width of 0.5.
   - Draw parallels at latitudes [-90, -45, 0, 45, 90] and meridians at longitudes [-180, -135, -90, -45, 0, 45, 90, 135, 180], spaced every 45 degrees.
   - Label the parallels and meridians appropriately to the left and bottom

7. Finalize Visualization:
   - Add a colorbar with a label set to the dataset's units.
   - Set the plot title using the HDF5 file name and dataset name without slashes.

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
How do I define a constant for an HDF5 file name, open the file with h5py, access the `/Grid/cloudWater` dataset, read the first x‑slice (index 0) while retaining all y and z dimensions, and retrieve the dataset’s `units` attribute?

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
What is the correct way to replace the dataset’s `_FillValue` with `np.nan` using `np.where`, then apply a mask with `np.ma.masked_where` for the `np.nan` values, and compute the masked array’s minimum and maximum?

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
How can I construct longitude and latitude arrays with 1440 points from –179.875 to 179.875 and 720 points from –89.875 to 89.875, set up a cylindrical map projection (cartopy or basemap) with low resolution, plot the masked cloudWater slice, add coastlines (linewidth 0.5), draw parallels at –90, –45, 0, 45, 90 and meridians at –180, –135, –90, –45, 0, 45, 90, 135, 180 with labels, and finally add a colorbar labeled with the dataset’s units and a title derived from the HDF5 file name and dataset name?
