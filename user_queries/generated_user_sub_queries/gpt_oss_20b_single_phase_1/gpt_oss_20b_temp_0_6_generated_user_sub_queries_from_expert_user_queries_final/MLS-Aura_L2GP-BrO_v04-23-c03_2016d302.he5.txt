"""
        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            A Python script to read an HDF-EOS5 file and plot BrO data against pressure levels with the following specifications:

1. Import Libraries: 
   Include os, matplotlib as mpl, matplotlib.pyplot as plt, mpl_toolkits.basemap.Basemap, numpy as np, datetime, matplotlib.ticker.FormatStrFormatter, and matplotlib.ticker.ScalarFormatter.

2. Read HDF-EOS5 File: 
   - Extract BrO data from the path `/HDFEOS/SWATHS/BrO/Data Fields/BrO`.
   - Retrieve pressure data from `/Geolocation Fields/Pressure`.
   - Obtain time data from `/Geolocation Fields/Time`.

3. Data Extraction:
   - Slice BrO data to get the 399th index along the x-axis and all data along the y-axis.
   - Convert BrO and pressure data into 1D arrays for plotting.

4. Attributes Handling: Extract attributes like MissingValue, _FillValue, Title, and Units from the BrO dataset.

5. Plotting:
   - Use matplotlib to plot BrO data (indices 12-16) against corresponding pressure values.
   - Set the x-axis label using BrO's title and units.
   - Set the y-axis label using pressure units.
   - Title the plot with BrO's title and the file's basename.

6. Plot Configuration:
   - Invert the y-axis.
   - Apply a logarithmic scale to the y-axis.
   - Use ScalarFormatter for minor ticks and FormatStrFormatter for major ticks.
   - At the end, the gca is set with invert_yaxis, yscale value of log, minor formatter is ScalarFormatter, and major formatter is FormatStrFormatter

        Note: return only the the response of sub-queries only based on the below format, not explanation, not python code, and node additional text needed
        Return format:

        HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
        <generated sub-query>

        NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
        <generated sub-query>

        Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
        <generated sub-query>
        """

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
Using h5py to open an HDF-EOS5 (.he5) file and access the BrO dataset at `/HDFEOS/SWATHS/BrO/Data Fields/BrO`, retrieve its attributes (MissingValue, _FillValue, Title, Units), and read the pressure and time geolocation fields from `/Geolocation Fields/Pressure` and `/Geolocation Fields/Time`.

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
Masking `_FillValue` in a NumPy array from h5py, slicing the BrO 2‑D array to extract the 399th x‑index as a 1‑D profile, and converting the pressure array to a 1‑D array for plotting, while handling missing values with `np.ma.masked_where` and computing min/max if needed.

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
Plotting a 1‑D BrO profile (indices 12‑16) against pressure using matplotlib, setting the x‑axis label with BrO Title and Units, the y‑axis label with pressure units, inverting the y‑axis, applying a logarithmic y‑scale, formatting minor ticks with `ScalarFormatter`, major ticks with `FormatStrFormatter`, and adding a title that includes the BrO Title and the file basename.
