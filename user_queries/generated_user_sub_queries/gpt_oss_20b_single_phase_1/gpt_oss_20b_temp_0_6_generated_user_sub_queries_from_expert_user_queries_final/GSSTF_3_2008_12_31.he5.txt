"""
        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            A Python script to visualize data from a GESDISC MEaSUREs GSSTF HDF-EOS5 grid file.

Steps:
1. Import necessary libraries: os, h5py, numpy as np, matplotlib as mpl, matplotlib.pyplot as plt, and mpl_toolkits.basemap import Basemap.
2. Read the HDF file located at 'GSSTF_3_2008_12_31.he5'.
3. Extract the 'E' dataset from '/HDFEOS/GRIDS/SET1/Data Fields/E', including its attributes ('units' and 'long_name') using decode(), and retrieve the _FillValue attribute.
4. Preprocess data by replacing _FillValue with np.nan and create a masked array using np.masked_array with conditions based on np.isnan(data).
5. Construct longitude and latitude arrays based on the shape of the 'E' dataset since they are not provided in the file.
6. Create a cylindrical projection map with boundaries set for low resolution, latitudes from -90 to 90, and longitudes from -180 to 180.
7. Add parallels at the result of numpy arrange value of [-90, 120, 30] degrees latitude with labels [1,0,0,0], 
    and meridians at the result of numpy arrange value of [-180, 180, 45] degrees longitude with labels [0,0,0,1].
8. Visualize the data using pcolormesh with parameters longitude, latitude, data, and latlon=True.
9. Add a colorbar and a descriptive title to the plot.

        Note: return only the the response of sub-queries only based on the below format, not explanation, not python code, and node additional text needed
        Return format:

        """

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
How to use h5py to open an HDF-EOS5 file (e.g., *.he5, *.h5, *.hdf5), navigate to the dataset path '/HDFEOS/GRIDS/SET1/Data Fields/E', read the dataset into a NumPy array, and retrieve its string attributes 'units' and 'long_name' as well as the numeric attribute '_FillValue', decoding any byte-string attributes to Python strings.

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
How to replace a dataset's _FillValue with np.nan, create a masked array using np.ma.masked_array that masks all np.nan values, and then compute statistics such as min and max while ignoring masked entries; also how to use np.where or np.ma.masked_where for conditional masking.

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
How to set up a cylindrical (PlateCarree) Basemap projection covering latitudes -90 to 90 and longitudes -180 to 180, add parallels at [-90, 120, 30] with appropriate label settings, add meridians at [-180, 180, 45] with label settings, plot a 2‑D array with pcolormesh using longitude and latitude grids, and add a colorbar and descriptive title.
