"""
        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            A Python script that processes an HDF5 file by following these structured steps:

1. Import Libraries: 
   Include necessary libraries such as `os`, `datetime`, `h5py`, `numpy` (as `np`), `matplotlib` (as `mpl`), `matplotlib.pyplot` (as `plt`), and `Basemap` from `mpl_toolkits.basemap`.

2. Open HDF5 File: Open the file "SMAP_L1B_TB_50719_D_20240730T124417_R19240_001.h5" in read-only mode.

3. Access Datasets: Extract datasets from the Brightness_Temperature group, specifically `tb_h_surface_corrected` (brightness temperature), `tb_lat` (latitude), and `tb_lon` (longitude).

4. Retrieve Attributes: For `tb_h_surface_corrected`, get attributes like units, long_name, _FillValue, valid_max, and valid_min. 
   Decode these attributes using 'ascii' encoding with 'replace' error handling.

5. Preprocess Data:
   - Identify invalid data points where values exceed valid_max or are below valid_min.
   - Update invalid points to include those equal to _FillValue.
   - Replace invalid data in `tb_h_surface_corrected` with NaNs.
   - Create a masked array using `numpy.ma.masked_where` based on NaN values.

6. Create Map Visualization:
   - Initialize a Basemap with cylindrical projection and set boundaries from -90 to 90 latitude and -180 to 180 longitude.
   - Add coastlines with linewidth 0.5.
   - Draw parallels at intervals of [-90, -45, 0, 45, 90] and meridians at intervals of [-180, -135, -90, -45, 0, 45, 90, 135, 180] with specific labels [True, False, False, True].
   - Plot data points using `plt.scatter` with parameters: longitude (x), latitude (y), data (c), point size 1, colormap 'jet', no edge color, and linewidth 0.

7. Enhance Visualization:
   - Add a colorbar with the label set to the units of the brightness temperature data.
   - Set the plot title to include the base name of the HDF5 file and the long_name attribute of the dataset, using fontsize 7.

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
Using h5py, how do I open an HDF5 file, navigate to the Brightness_Temperature group, read datasets tb_h_surface_corrected, tb_lat, tb_lon, and retrieve attributes units, long_name, _FillValue, valid_max, valid_min, decoding them with ascii and replace error handling?

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
With NumPy, how can I identify and replace values in tb_h_surface_corrected that are outside valid_min/valid_max or equal to _FillValue with NaN, then create a masked array using numpy.ma.masked_where based on NaNs?

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
Using matplotlib and Basemap, how do I set up a cylindrical projection covering latitudes -90 to 90 and longitudes -180 to 180, add coastlines, draw specified parallels and meridians, plot longitude/latitude points with a scatter using the brightness temperature data as color, apply a jet colormap, add a colorbar labeled with the units attribute, and set a title including the file base name and long_name attribute?
