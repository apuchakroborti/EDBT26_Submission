"""
        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            A Python script that performs the following steps:

1. Open an HDF5 file in read mode using h5py and extract the dataset 'Tb' from the group `S1`, 
including its 'unit' and 'fillValue' attributes. Also, retrieve geolocation data from 'Latitude' and 'Longitude'.

2. Mask NaN values in the 'Tb' dataset using numpy's masked_where function with parameters based on numpy's isnan.

3. Create a cylindrical projection map with specific settings (low resolution, -90 to 90 latitude range, -180 to 180 longitude range etc.). 
it also adds coastlines with width 0.5, parrallels with every 45 degree from -90 to 90 degree.
After that it also add meridians to every 45 degree from -180 to 180 with left and bottom labels 

4. Plot the dataset as a scatter plot on the map using the 'jet' colormap, setting each point's size to 1.

5. Add a colorbar below the plot with padding of 10% and label it using the units extracted from the 'Tb' dataset.

6. Set the plot title by combining the HDF5 file's basename, the string "Tb", and "(nchan1=0)".

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
How to use h5py to open an HDF5 file, navigate to group `S1`, read the dataset `Tb` along with its attributes `unit` and `fillValue`, and also read the datasets `Latitude` and `Longitude` from the file?

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
How to apply `np.ma.masked_where(np.isnan(data), data)` to mask NaN values in a NumPy array, and how to incorporate an HDF5 `_FillValue` attribute into the masking logic?

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
How to create a cylindrical projection map with matplotlib/cartopy or mpl_toolkits.basemap, add coastlines (width 0.5), parallels every 45° from -90° to 90°, meridians every 45° from -180° to 180° with left and bottom labels, plot a scatter of data points using the 'jet' colormap and size 1, add a colorbar below the plot with 10% padding and label it with the dataset units, and set the title combining the file basename, "Tb", and "(nchan1=0)"?
