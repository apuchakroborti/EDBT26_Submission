"""
        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            1. Define Constants:  
   Set the constant `FILE_NAME` to the path of the HDF5 file: "ATL03_20181027235521_04480111_006_02.h5".

2. Open HDF5 File and Access Datasets:  
   Open the HDF5 file in read mode and access these datasets:
   - `reference_photon_lat` as latitude data and `reference_photon_lon` as longitude data from the `/gt1l/geolocation`
   - `/gt1l/geolocation/tx_pulse_energy` for the main data.

3. Extract Dataset Attributes:  
   For the tx_pulse_energy dataset, read the `units` and `long name` attributes using `.decode('ascii', 'replace')`. 
   Also, retrieve the `fillValue` attribute from the main dataset.

4. Create Map Projection:  
   Use an equidistant cylindrical projection with low resolution. Set the latitude range from -90 to 90 and longitude range from -180 to 180.

5. Customize Map Features:  
   Add coastlines with a line width of 0.5. Draw parallels at intervals of 30 degree from -90 to 120 
   and meridians at intervals of 45 degree from -180 to 180

6. Plot Data on the Map:  
   Use the `scatter` function with longitude as x, latitude as y, data for color (c parameter), marker size of 0.1, colormap 'jet', no edge colors, and zero linewidth.

7. Add Colorbar and Title:  
   Append a colorbar with format '%.2e' labeled using the main dataset's units. Set the plot title to include the HDF5 file's basename and the `long name` attribute of the main dataset.

        Note: return only the the response of sub-queries only based on the below format, not explanation, not python code, and node additional text needed
        Return format:

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:  
Using h5py to open an HDF5 file, access datasets such as `/gt1l/geolocation/reference_photon_lat` and `/gt1l/geolocation/reference_photon_lon`, read attributes `units` and `long_name` from a dataset, decode them with `.decode('ascii', 'replace')`, and retrieve the `fillValue` attribute from a dataset.  

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:  
Handling `_FillValue` in NumPy arrays: how to replace or mask fill values using `np.where` or `np.ma.masked_where`, and compute or filter data after masking (e.g., using `min`, `max`, or other preprocessing logic).  

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:  
Using matplotlib and cartopy to create an equidistant cylindrical projection, add coastlines, draw parallels every 30° and meridians every 45°, scatter plot latitude/longitude data with color mapping, set marker size, colormap, no edge colors, add a colorbar with format `'%.2e'`, and set a title including the file basename and dataset `long_name`.
