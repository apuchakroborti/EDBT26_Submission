"""
        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            A Python script to read an HDF-EOS5 file and plot BrO data against pressure levels with the following specifications:

1. Read HDF-EOS5 File: 
   - Extract BrO data from the group `/HDFEOS/SWATHS/BrO/Data Fields`.
   - Retrieve pressure data from `/Geolocation Fields/Pressure`.
   - Obtain time data from `/Geolocation Fields/Time`.

2. Data Extraction:
   - Slice BrO data to get the 399th index along the x-axis and all data along the y-axis.
   - Convert BrO and pressure data into 1D arrays for plotting.

3. Attributes Handling: Extract attributes like MissingValue, _FillValue, Title, and Units.

4. Plotting:
   - Use matplotlib to plot BrO data (indices 12-16) against corresponding pressure values.
   - Set the x-axis label using BrO's title and units.
   - Set the y-axis label using pressure units.
   - Title the plot with BrO's title and the file's basename.

5. Plot Configuration:
   - Invert the y-axis.
   - Apply a logarithmic scale to the y-axis.
   - Use ScalarFormatter for minor ticks and FormatStrFormatter for major ticks.
   - At the end, the gca is set with invert_yaxis, yscale value of log, minor formatter is ScalarFormatter, and major formatter is FormatStrFormatter

        Note: return only the the response of sub-queries only based on the below format, not explanation, not python code, and node additional text needed
        Return format:

        """

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
How to use h5py to open an HDF-EOS5 file (e.g., .he5, .h5, .hdf5) and read datasets '/HDFEOS/SWATHS/BrO/Data Fields', '/Geolocation Fields/Pressure', '/Geolocation Fields/Time', and retrieve attributes such as MissingValue, _FillValue, Title, and Units from these datasets.

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
Using NumPy, how to slice a 2D BrO array to extract the 399th column (x‑axis index 399) across all rows, flatten it to a 1D array, apply a mask for _FillValue or MissingValue, and then select indices 12‑16 for plotting, while also converting the corresponding pressure data to a 1D array.

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
With matplotlib, how to plot BrO values (indices 12‑16) against pressure values, set the x‑axis label using BrO’s Title and Units, the y‑axis label using pressure Units, title the plot with BrO Title and the file’s basename, invert the y‑axis, apply a logarithmic scale, and configure minor ticks with ScalarFormatter and major ticks with FormatStrFormatter.
