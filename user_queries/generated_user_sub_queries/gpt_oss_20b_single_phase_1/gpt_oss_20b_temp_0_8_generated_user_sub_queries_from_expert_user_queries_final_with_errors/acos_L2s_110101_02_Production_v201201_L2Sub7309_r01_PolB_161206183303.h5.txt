"""
        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            A script that performs the following steps:

1. Define a constant FILE_NAME with the name of the HDF5 file to be processed.

2. Open the specified HDF5 file in read-only mode.

3. Extract datasets from the file:
   - `xco2` for xCO2 data
   - `sounding_latitude_geoid` for latitude data
   - `sounding_longitude_geoid` for longitude data
   - `sounding_altitude` for altitude data
   - `sounding_time_tai93` for time data

4. Retrieve the 'Unit' attribute from both `xco2` and altitude datasets at index 0.

5. Create a figure with two subplots:
   - First subplot: Orthographic projection map with low resolution, centered at lat_0 = -55 and lon_0 = 120, 
   displaying the sounding trajectory using latitude and longitude coordinates.
   - Second subplot: Line plot showing time vs xco2 data, with a twin axis for time vs altitude data.

6. Customize the map by adding:
   - Coastlines with a line width of 0.5
   - Parallels at latitudes [-80, -60, -40, -20, 0]
   - Meridians at longitudes from -180 to 180 with interval of 20

7. Customize both plots by setting appropriate axis labels, titles, and tick formats.

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:  
How to use `h5py` to open an HDF5 file (extensions .h5, .hdf5, .HE5, .he5) in read‑only mode, access datasets such as `xco2`, `sounding_latitude_geoid`, `sounding_longitude_geoid`, `sounding_altitude`, and `sounding_time_tai93`, retrieve the `Unit` attribute from the first element of the `xco2` and `sounding_altitude` datasets, and read dataset data into NumPy arrays.

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:  
How to handle a `_FillValue` in a NumPy array, apply masks using `np.where` or `np.ma.masked_where`, filter out missing data, compute `min` and `max` values, and prepare cleaned arrays for plotting time series or trajectory data.

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:  
How to create a figure with two subplots using `matplotlib` and `cartopy` (or `mpl_toolkits.basemap`), set an orthographic projection with low resolution centered at `lat_0 = -55`, `lon_0 = 120`, plot a sounding trajectory with latitude and longitude, add coastlines (linewidth 0.5), parallels at [-80, -60, -40, -20, 0], meridians from -180 to 180 every 20°, and in a second subplot plot time vs xCO₂ with a twin axis for time vs altitude, including axis labels, titles, and tick formatting.
