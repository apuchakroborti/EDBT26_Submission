"""
        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            A Python script that processes an HDF5 file and generates a geospatial plot as follows:

1. Load Data: Open the HDF5 file "1C.F19.SSMIS.XCAL2021-V.20160105-S214106-E232259.009078.V07A.HDF5" in read-only mode using h5py.

2. Extract Dataset: Access the `Tc` dataset from the group `S1` of hierarchical dataset, 
    which is 3D. Extract all data from the first and second dimensions at the 0th index of the third dimension. 
Retrieve attributes: 'Units', 'longname', and 'Fillvalue'.

3. Data Cleaning: Replace values matching Fillvalue with NaN in the Tc dataset.

4. Geolocation Data: Read latitude from "Latitude" and longitude from "Longitude".

5. Map Setup: Create a cylindrical projection map with low resolution, latitude range -90 to 90, and longitude range -180 to 180. 
Add coastlines (width 0.5), parallels at [-90, -45, 0, 45, 90], 
and meridians at [-180, -135, -90, -45, 0, 45, 90, 135, 180] with left and bottom labels.

6. Plot Data: Display Tc data as a scatter plot on the map using 'jet' colormap and point size 1.

7. Colorbar: Add a colorbar below the plot with 10% padding, labeled with the units from Tc's attributes.

8. Title: Set the title to include the file basename, Tc's LongName, and " (nchannel1=0)".

This structured approach ensures clarity for code generation by an LLM.

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
Open the HDF5 file “1C.F19.SSMIS.XCAL2021-V.20160105-S214106-E232259.009078.V07A.HDF5” in read‑only mode with h5py, access the 3‑D dataset at path “/S1/Tc”, slice it to obtain the first two dimensions at the 0th index of the third dimension (e.g., `data = f['/S1/Tc'][:, :, 0]`), read the attributes “Units”, “longname”, and “Fillvalue” from that dataset, and also read the latitude and longitude datasets named “Latitude” and “Longitude”.

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
Take the NumPy array obtained from the Tc dataset, replace all values equal to the Fillvalue with `np.nan` (using `np.where` or `np.ma.masked_where`), and then compute the minimum and maximum of the cleaned data while ignoring NaNs (e.g., `np.nanmin` and `np.nanmax`).

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
Using matplotlib and cartopy (or mpl_toolkits.basemap), create a cylindrical projection map with low resolution, latitude limits -90 to 90 and longitude limits -180 to 180; add coastlines with width 0.5, parallels at [-90, -45, 0, 45, 90] and meridians at [-180, -135, -90, -45, 0, 45, 90, 135, 180] with left and bottom labels. Scatter the cleaned Tc data points on the map with the “jet” colormap and point size 1, add a colorbar below the plot with 10 % padding and label it with the units attribute, and set the plot title to include the file basename, the Tc longname, and “ (nchannel1=0)”.
