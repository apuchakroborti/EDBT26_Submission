"""
        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            A Python script that reads ozone data from an HDF5 file and generates a visualization.

1. Read HDF5 File: Open the specified HDF5 file using h5py to access its contents.

2. Extract Datasets:
   - Retrieve the 3D ProfileOzone data from `ProfileOzone`.
   - Extract Latitude data from `Latitude`.
   - Obtain ProfilePressureLevels from `ProfilePressureLevels`.
   - Fetch Date data from `Date`.
   All from the group `Data_Fields`
   
3. Extract Attributes: From the ProfileOzone, Latitude, and ProfilePressureLevels datasets, extract the 'Units' and 'long name' attributes for labeling purposes.

4. Data Processing:
   - Slice ProfileOzone to get the 0th index along the x-axis (ProfileOzone[0, :, :]).
   - Extract the 0th index from Date data.
   - Replace _FillValue in ProfileOzone with NaN using numpy's masked_where function.

5. Transform Pressure Levels: Apply log10 transformation to ProfilePressureLevels.

6. Create Visualization:
   - Use contourf to plot latitude vs. transformed pressure levels with ozone data.
   - Add a colorbar labeled with ozone units.
   - Set x-axis label to Latitude's long name and units.
   - Set y-axis label to a combination of Pressure Levels' long name and units.
   - Set the title to include the HDF5 filename and ProfileOzone's long name.

7. Display Plot: Render the plot using matplotlib's show function.

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:  
How can I use h5py to open an HDF5 file with extensions such as .h5, .HDF5, or .HE5, list its groups and datasets, read the datasets `/Data_Fields/ProfileOzone`, `/Data_Fields/Latitude`, `/Data_Fields/ProfilePressureLevels`, and `/Data_Fields/Date`, and extract the attributes `Units` and `long_name` from each of these datasets for labeling purposes?

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:  
What are the steps to slice a 3‑D NumPy array to obtain the first index along the first axis (e.g., `ProfileOzone[0, :, :]`), extract the first element from a 1‑D array (e.g., `Date[0]`), replace a dataset’s `_FillValue` with `np.nan` using `np.ma.masked_where`, and apply a logarithmic transformation (`np.log10`) to a 1‑D pressure levels array in preparation for plotting?

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:  
How can I create a contourf plot in matplotlib where the x‑axis is latitude, the y‑axis is the log10‑transformed pressure levels, and the filled contours represent ozone concentration, including adding a colorbar labeled with ozone units, setting x‑axis and y‑axis labels from the latitude and pressure levels long names and units, setting a title that includes the HDF5 filename and ozone long name, and finally displaying the figure?
