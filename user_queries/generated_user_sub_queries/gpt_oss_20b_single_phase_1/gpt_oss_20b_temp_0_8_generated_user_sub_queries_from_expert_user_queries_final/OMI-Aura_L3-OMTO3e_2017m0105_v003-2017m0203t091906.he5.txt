"""
        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            A Python code that performs the following steps:

1. Import necessary libraries: os, datetime, h5py, numpy as np, matplotlib as mpl, matplotlib.pyplot as plt, and Basemap from mpl_toolkits.basemap.

2. Define two constants:
   - FILE_NAME: Path to the input HDF5 file "OMI-Aura_L3-OMTO3e_2017m0105_v003-2017m0203t091906.he5".
   - DATAFIELD_NAME: Path to the dataset "/HDFEOS/GRIDS/OMI Column Amount O3/Data Fields/ColumnAmountO3".

3. Open the HDF5 file in read mode and access the dataset specified by DATAFIELD_NAME.

4. Read the entire dataset into memory, replacing _FillValue with NaN using numpy's isnan function to create a mask.

5. Generate synthetic geolocation data:
   - Create longitude values from -179.875 to 179.875 with 1440 points.
   - Create latitude values from -89.875 to 89.875 with 720 points.

6. Extract the 'title' and 'units' attributes from the dataset, decoding them from bytes to UTF-8 strings.

7. Use Basemap to create a cylindrical projection map:
   - Set resolution to 'low'.
   - Define latitude bounds from -90 to 90 and longitude bounds from -180 to 180.
   - Add coastlines with a line width of 0.5.
   - Draw parallels at latitudes [-90, -60, -30, 0, 30, 60, 90, 120] with labels [1, 0, 0, 0].
   - Draw meridians at longitudes [-180, -135, -90, -45, 0, 0, 45, 90, 135, 180] with labels [0, 0, 0, 1].

8. Plot the data using pcolormesh:
   - Use longitude and latitude arrays for coordinates.
   - Set latlon=True and colormap to 'jet'.

9. Add a colorbar with labels set to the extracted units attribute.

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
How to open an HDF5 (.he5, .h5, .hdf5) file with h5py, navigate to a dataset using a full path (e.g., "/HDFEOS/GRIDS/OMI Column Amount O3/Data Fields/ColumnAmountO3"), read the dataset into a NumPy array, and extract and decode attributes such as 'title' and 'units' from bytes to UTF‑8 strings.

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
How to replace a dataset’s _FillValue with np.nan, create a boolean mask of invalid values, and apply NumPy functions (np.where, np.ma.masked_where) to preprocess the data, including computing min/max and filtering out NaNs.

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
How to use matplotlib with mpl_toolkits.basemap to create a cylindrical projection map (resolution 'low', lat/lon bounds ±90/±180), add coastlines, draw specified parallels and meridians with labels, plot a 2‑D dataset using pcolormesh with lon/lat coordinates, set a colormap (e.g., 'jet'), and add a colorbar labeled with a units string.
