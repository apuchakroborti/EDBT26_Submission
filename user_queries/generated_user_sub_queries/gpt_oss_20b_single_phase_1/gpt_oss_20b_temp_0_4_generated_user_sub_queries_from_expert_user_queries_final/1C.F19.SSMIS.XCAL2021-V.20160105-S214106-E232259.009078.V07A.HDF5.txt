"""
        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            A Python script that processes an HDF5 file and generates a geospatial plot as follows:

1. Import Libraries: Use os, matplotlib, matplotlib.pyplot, numpy, mpl_toolkits.basemap, and h5py.

2. Load Data: Open the HDF5 file "1C.F19.SSMIS.XCAL2021-V.20160105-S214106-E232259.009078.V07A.HDF5" in read-only mode using h5py.

3. Extract Dataset: Access the "/S1/Tc" dataset, which is 3D. Extract all data from the first and second dimensions at the 0th index of the third dimension. 
Retrieve attributes: 'units', 'LongName', and '_FillValue'.

4. Data Cleaning: Replace values matching _FillValue with NaN in the Tc dataset.

5. Geolocation Data: Read latitude from "/S1/Latitude" and longitude from "/S1/Longitude".

6. Map Setup: Create a cylindrical projection map with low resolution, latitude range -90 to 90, and longitude range -180 to 180. Add coastlines (width 0.5), 
parallels at [-90, -45, 0, 45, 90], and meridians at [-180, -135, -90, -45, 0, 45, 90, 135, 180] with labels [True, False, False, True].

7. Plot Data: Display Tc data as a scatter plot on the map using 'jet' colormap and point size 1.

8. Colorbar: Add a colorbar below the plot with 10% padding, labeled with the units from Tc's attributes.

9. Title: Set the title to include the file basename, Tc's LongName, and " (nchannel1=0)".

This structured approach ensures clarity for code generation by an LLM.

        Note: return only the the response of sub-queries only based on the below format, not explanation, not python code, and node additional text needed
        Return format:

        <generated sub-query>

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
Using h5py, open an HDF5 file in read‑only mode, access the 3D dataset “/S1/Tc”, read its attributes “units”, “LongName”, and “_FillValue”, and also read the latitude and longitude datasets “/S1/Latitude” and “/S1/Longitude”.

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
Replace values equal to the _FillValue in a NumPy array with NaN using np.where or np.ma.masked_where, then compute the minimum and maximum of the cleaned array.

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
Create a cylindrical Basemap projection with low resolution, latitude range –90 to 90, longitude range –180 to 180, add coastlines, parallels [–90, –45, 0, 45, 90], meridians [–180, –135, –90, –45, 0, 45, 90, 135, 180] with labels, plot the Tc data as a scatter plot with point size 1 and the “jet” colormap, add a colorbar below the plot with 10 % padding labeled with the units attribute, and set the title to include the file basename, Tc’s LongName, and “(nchannel1=0)”.
