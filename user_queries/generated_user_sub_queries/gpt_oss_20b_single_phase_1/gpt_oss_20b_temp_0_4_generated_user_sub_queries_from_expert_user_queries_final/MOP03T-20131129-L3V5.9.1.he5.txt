"""
        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            A Python script that processes and visualizes HDF data using specific libraries and steps.

1. Imports: Include necessary libraries such as `os`, `datetime`, `h5py`, `numpy` as `np`, `matplotlib` as `mpl`, `matplotlib.pyplot` as `plt`, and `Basemap` from `mpl_toolkits.basemap`.

2. Read HDF Data: 
   Access the dataset `/HDFEOS/GRIDS/MOP03/Data Fields/RetrievedSurfaceTemperatureDay` into a variable named `data`. 
   Extract attributes `long_name`, `units`, and `_FillValue`, decoding `long_name` and `units`.

3. Data Preprocessing:
   - Replace `_FillValue` with `NaN`.
   - Mask data using `numpy.ma.masked_array` where values are not `NaN`.

4. Geolocation Data: 
   Then it reads the geolocation data
   - `/HDFEOS/GRIDS/MOP03/Data Fields/Latitude`, which contains latitude values
   - `/HDFEOS/GRIDS/MOP03/Data Fields/Longitude`, which contains longitude values
   Read latitude and longitude from respective datasets into variables `x` and `y`, then create a meshgrid.

5. Basemap Setup:
   - Use cylindrical projection with low resolution.
   - Set boundaries from -90 to 90 for latitude and -180 to 180 for longitude.
   - Add coastlines, parallels at intervals of 45 degrees from -90 to 90, and meridians similarly from -180 to 180, labeling the first and last ones such as [True, False, False, True].

6. Visualization: 
   - Use `plt.scatter` with parameters including data, colormap 'jet', no edge colors, and linewidth 0.
   - Add a colorbar labeled with the units attribute.

7. Cleanup: Include `plt.show()` or save the figure as needed.

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
How do I open an HDF5 file (extensions .h5, .hdf5, .HE5, .he5) with h5py, access the dataset at path `/HDFEOS/GRIDS/MOP03/Data Fields/RetrievedSurfaceTemperatureDay`, read its attributes `long_name`, `units`, and `_FillValue`, and decode the string attributes correctly?

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
What is the recommended way to replace a dataset’s `_FillValue` with `np.nan`, create a masked array that masks all non‑NaN values using `numpy.ma.masked_array` or `numpy.ma.masked_where`, and then compute the minimum and maximum of the masked data with NumPy functions?

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
How can I use matplotlib with Basemap to plot a 2‑D geospatial dataset: set up a cylindrical projection with latitude limits -90 to 90 and longitude limits -180 to 180, add coastlines, draw parallels and meridians at 45‑degree intervals (labeling only the first and last), scatter plot the data with the 'jet' colormap, and add a colorbar labeled with the dataset’s units?
