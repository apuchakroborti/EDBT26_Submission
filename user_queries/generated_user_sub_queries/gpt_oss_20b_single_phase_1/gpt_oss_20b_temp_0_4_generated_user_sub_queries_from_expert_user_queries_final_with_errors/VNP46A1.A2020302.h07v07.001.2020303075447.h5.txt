"""
        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            A Python script that reads and visualizes data from an HDF-EOS5 file, specifically a LAADS VNP46A1 Geographic projection Grid file.

The script performs the following tasks:

1. Import Libraries: The script begins by importing necessary libraries

2. Read HDF5 File: The script opens an HDF5 file in read-only mode using `h5py`. It reads three datasets:
   - `BrightnessTemperature_M12` from the sub group path `/HDFEOS/GRIDS/VNP_Grid_DNB/Data Fields`: This dataset is referred to as "BrightnessTemperature". 
      All data from this dataset are read and converted to a float type using `astype(np.float)`.
   - The script accesses specific attributes such as `scale_factor`, `add_offset`, `units` (decoded), `_FillValue`, and `long_name` (decoded).

3. Extract Grid Metadata: The script reads metadata from `/HDFEOS INFORMATION/StructMetadata.0`. It extracts the upper-left and lower-right coordinates of the grid from this metadata string.

4. Construct Grid and Plot:
   - A 2D grid is constructed using `numpy.meshgrid` to create longitude and latitude arrays for plotting.
   - The data are plotted on a cylindrical map projection with latitude ranging from -90 to 90 and longitude from -180 to 180.
   - Coastlines are added with a line width of 0.5.
   - Parallels are drawn at intervals of 30 degrees (from -90 to 120) with labels at left
   - Meridians are drawn every 45 degrees with specific labels (from -180 to 180 ) with labels at bottom

5. Visualize Data: 
   - A `pcolormesh` is added using longitude and latitude coordinates (taking every 10th value for plotting).
   - A colorbar is included, labeled with the units from the dataset attributes.
   - The plot title is a concatenation of the data file's basename and the `long_name` attribute.

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
How can I use h5py to open an HDF-EOS5 file, navigate to the BrightnessTemperature_M12 dataset at `/HDFEOS/GRIDS/VNP_Grid_DNB/Data Fields`, read its data and attributes such as `scale_factor`, `add_offset`, `units`, `_FillValue`, and `long_name`, and extract the upper-left and lower-right coordinates from the `/HDFEOS INFORMATION/StructMetadata.0` metadata string?

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
What steps should I take in NumPy to convert the BrightnessTemperature dataset to float, apply the `scale_factor` and `add_offset`, mask out values equal to `_FillValue` using `np.ma.masked_where` or `np.where`, and optionally filter the data to a specific range using `min`/`max` thresholds?

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
How can I use matplotlib with cartopy (or basemap) to create a cylindrical projection plot of the masked BrightnessTemperature data, generate longitude and latitude grids with `numpy.meshgrid`, plot every 10th data point using `pcolormesh`, add coastlines, parallels every 30°, meridians every 45°, include a colorbar labeled with the units attribute, and set a title combining the file basename and the `long_name` attribute?
