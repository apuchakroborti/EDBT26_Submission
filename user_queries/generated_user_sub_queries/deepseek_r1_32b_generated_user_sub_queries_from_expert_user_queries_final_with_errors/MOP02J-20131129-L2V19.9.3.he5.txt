        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            File Input and Constants
- Specify the input file as `MOP02J-20131129-L2V19.9.3.he5` stored in the constant `FILE_NAME`.

Extracting Data
- Extract data from the HDF5 dataset at `RetrievedSurfaceTemperature` from the group `/HDFEOS/SWATHS/MOP02/Data Fields`.
- Read the first column of this dataset into an array named `data`.
- Retrieve the `units` and `_FillValue` attributes.
- Decode the `units` string using the `decode()` function.

Data Preprocessing and Cleaning
- Replace values in `data` that match `_FillValue` with `numpy.nan`.

Extracting Geolocation Data
- Extract latitude data from `Latitude`, longitude data from `Longitude` from the group `/HDFEOS/SWATHS/MOP02/Geolocation Fields`

Creating a Map
- Add coastlines with a line width of 0.5.
- Draw parallels from -90 to 90 with interval of 45 degree.
- Draw meridians using from -180 to 180 with interval of 45 degree and set labels to left and bottom

Scatter Plot Configuration
- Use the `scatter` function with parameters: longitude, latitude, `c=data`, marker size `s=1`, colormap `plt.cm.jet`, no edge colors (`edgecolors=None`), and line width `linewidth=0`.

Customizing the Map
- Add a colorbar to represent data units.
- Set the colorbar label using the decoded `units` value.

Okay, so I need to break down this user query into three specific sub-queries. Let me read through the user's instructions carefully.

First, they want me to handle HDF5 dataset access using h5py. The user mentioned accessing a file named `MOP02J-20131129-L2V19.9.3.he5` and extracting data from specific groups and datasets. They also need to retrieve attributes like units and _FillValue, and decode the units string.

Next, for NumPy-based preprocessing, they want to replace _FillValue in the data array with NaNs using np.where or masked arrays. That's straightforward; I'll focus on how to handle that replacement efficiently.

Lastly, the visualization part involves creating a map with coastlines, parallels, and meridians using matplotlib or cartopy. They also need a scatter plot of the data points and a colorbar labeled with the units. I should make sure to include all these elements in the sub-query.

I'll structure each sub-query clearly, ensuring they cover only their respective domains without overlapping.

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
How to access the HDF5 file MOP02J-20131129-L2V19.9.3.he5 using h5py, extract data from /HDFEOS/SWATHS/MOP02/Data Fields/RetrievedSurfaceTemperature, read the first column into an array named data, retrieve units and _FillValue attributes, and decode the units string.

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
How to replace values in a NumPy array that match a specific _FillValue with numpy.nan using np.where or np.ma.masked_where.

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
How to create a map plot using matplotlib, mpl_toolkits.basemap, or cartopy with coastlines, parallels from -90 to 90 every 45 degrees, meridians from -180 to 180 every 45 degrees with labels on left and bottom, add a scatter plot of geolocation data with specified parameters, and include a colorbar labeled with the decoded units.
