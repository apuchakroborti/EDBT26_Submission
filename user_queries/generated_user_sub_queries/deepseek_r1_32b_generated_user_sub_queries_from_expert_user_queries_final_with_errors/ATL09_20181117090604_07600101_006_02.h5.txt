        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            A Python script that processes an HDF5 file and visualizes data on a map. The script should:

1. Define the constant FILE_NAME as 'ATL09_20181117090604_07600101_006_02.h5'.

2. Open the HDF5 file in read mode and access three datasets:
   - 'latitude' for latitude data.
   - 'longitude' for longitude data.
   - 'apparent_surf_reflec' as the main data.
   all from the sub group path `/profile_1/high_rate`
   
3. Read attributes 'units' and 'long_name' using decode('ascii', 'replace') from the apparent_surf_reflec dataset.

4. Create a map with an equidistant cylindrical projection, low resolution, latitude from -90 to 90, longitude from -180 to 180.

5. Add coastlines with linewidth 0.5, parallels at [-90, -60, -30, 0, 30, 60, 90, 120] and meridians at [-180, -135, -90, -45, 0, 45, 90, 135, 180].

6. Generate a scatter plot using longitude and latitude data, with markers of size 0.1, colormap 'jet', no edge colors, and linewidth 0.

7. Add a colorbar labeled with the main dataset's units and set the title to include the file basename and long_name.

Okay, I need to break down the user's query into three specific sub-queries. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, the user wants a Python script that processes an HDF5 file. They mentioned using h5py for accessing datasets and attributes. So, the first sub-query should focus on opening the file, accessing the specified datasets under '/profile_1/high_rate', and reading the attributes with decoding. That covers the HDF5 part.

Next, they're handling data preprocessing. The script needs to read latitude, longitude, and apparent_surf_reflec data. They also mentioned using NumPy for creating a mask where values are greater than 0. This falls under the NumPy-based preprocessing sub-query.

Lastly, the visualization part involves matplotlib and basemap. They want a specific map projection, adding coastlines, parallels, meridians, a scatter plot with certain parameters, a colorbar, and setting the title. So, the third sub-query should cover all these plotting aspects.

I need to make sure each sub-query is clear and targets only its respective domain without overlapping.
