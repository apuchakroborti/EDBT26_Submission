        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            A Python script that processes and visualizes HDF data using specific libraries and steps.

1. Imports: 
   Include necessary libraries.

2. Read HDF Data: 
   Access the dataset `RetrievedSurfaceTemperatureDay` from the group `/HDFEOS/GRIDS/MOP03/Data Fields` into a variable named `data`. 
   Extract attributes `long name`, `Units`, and `FillValue`, decoding `long_name` and `units`.

3. Data Preprocessing:
   - Replace `_FillValue` with `NaN`.
   - Mask data using `numpy.ma.masked_array` where values are not `NaN`.

4. Geolocation Data: 
   Then it reads the geolocation data
   - `Latitude`, which contains latitude values, `Longitude`, which contains longitude values from the group `/HDFEOS/GRIDS/MOP03/Data Fields`
   Read latitude and longitude from respective datasets into variables `x` and `y`, then create a meshgrid.

5. Basemap Setup:
   - Use cylindrical projection with low resolution.
   - Set boundaries from -90 to 90 for latitude and -180 to 180 for longitude.
   - Add coastlines, parallels at intervals of 45 degrees from -90 to 90, 
      and meridians similarly from -180 to 180, labeling to left and bottom.

6. Visualization: 
   - Use `plt.scatter` with parameters including data, colormap 'jet', no edge colors, and linewidth 0.
   - Add a colorbar labeled with the units attribute.

7. Cleanup: Include `plt.show()` or save the figure as needed.

Okay, so I need to break down this user query into three specific sub-queries. The user is asking for a Python script that processes and visualizes HDF data using certain libraries and steps. They've provided a detailed breakdown of the tasks they want to accomplish.

First, I'll look at the first part: accessing the HDF5 dataset. The user mentions using h5py to access specific datasets and attributes. So, the sub-query should focus on how to use h5py to open the file, navigate through groups, access the 'RetrievedSurfaceTemperatureDay' dataset, and extract the required attributes like long name, units, and FillValue.

Next, for the data preprocessing part, they want to handle _FillValue by replacing it with NaNs and then masking the data. This means I need a sub-query that specifically addresses using NumPy functions like np.where or masked_array to replace fill values and create masks.

Lastly, the visualization part involves setting up a map using matplotlib, basemap, or cartopy. The user wants a cylindrical projection, specific boundaries, coastlines, meridians, parallels, and a colorbar. So, the sub-query should cover how to set up the basemap with these parameters and visualize the data accordingly.

I need to make sure each sub-query is clear and targets only one technical domain as specified.

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
How to use h5py to access the dataset 'RetrievedSurfaceTemperatureDay' from the group '/HDFEOS/GRIDS/MOP03/Data Fields', extract attributes including long name, Units, and FillValue, and decode them.

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
How to replace _FillValue with NaN in a NumPy array and create a masked array using numpy.ma.masked_array where values are not NaN.

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
How to set up a cylindrical projection map using matplotlib or basemap, add coastlines, parallels at 45 degree intervals from -90 to 90, meridians at 45 degree intervals from -180 to 180 with labels on left and bottom, plot data with plt.scatter using 'jet' colormap without edges, and add a colorbar labeled with units.
