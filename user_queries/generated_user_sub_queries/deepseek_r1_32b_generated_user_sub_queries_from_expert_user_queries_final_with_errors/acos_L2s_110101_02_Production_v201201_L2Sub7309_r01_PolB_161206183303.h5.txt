        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            A script that performs the following steps:

1. Define a constant FILE_NAME with the name of the HDF5 file to be processed.

2. Open the specified HDF5 file in read-only mode.

3. Extract datasets from the file:
   - `xco2` for xCO2 data
   - `sounding_latitude_geoid` for latitude data
   - `sounding_longitude_geoid` for longitude data
   - `sounding_altitude` for altitude data
   - `sounding_time_tai93` for time data

4. Retrieve the 'Unit' attribute from both `xco2` and altitude datasets at index 0.

5. Create a figure with two subplots:
   - First subplot: Orthographic projection map with low resolution, centered at lat_0 = -55 and lon_0 = 120, 
   displaying the sounding trajectory using latitude and longitude coordinates.
   - Second subplot: Line plot showing time vs xco2 data, with a twin axis for time vs altitude data.

6. Customize the map by adding:
   - Coastlines with a line width of 0.5
   - Parallels at latitudes [-80, -60, -40, -20, 0]
   - Meridians at longitudes from -180 to 180 with interval of 20

7. Customize both plots by setting appropriate axis labels, titles, and tick formats.

Okay, I need to break down the user's query into three specific sub-queries as per their instructions. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, looking at the HDF5 Dataset Access section. The user wants to open an HDF5 file and extract several datasets. They also need to retrieve specific attributes from two of these datasets. So I'll focus on using h5py for opening the file in read-only mode, accessing the datasets by their names, and getting the 'Unit' attribute from xco2 and altitude at index 0.

Next, the NumPy-based Data Preprocessing part. The user mentions handling _FillValue, which suggests they might need to mask or filter data based on this value. They also want to create a figure with two subplots, but that's more about visualization. For preprocessing, I'll focus on how to handle any fill values using NumPy functions like np.where or masked arrays.

Lastly, the Plotting and Visualization section requires creating two subplots. The first is an orthographic map showing the trajectory, and the second is a line plot with twin axes for time vs xco2 and altitude. I'll need to use matplotlib along with basemap or cartopy for the map projection, adding coastlines, parallels, meridians, and customizing both plots with labels and titles.

I should make sure each sub-query is clear and targets only its specific domain without overlapping into others.

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
How to open an HDF5 file in read-only mode using h5py, access datasets named 'xco2', 'sounding_latitude_geoid', 'sounding_longitude_geoid', 'sounding_altitude', and 'sounding_time_tai93', and retrieve the 'Unit' attribute from both 'xco2' and 'sounding_altitude' datasets at index 0.

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
How to handle _FillValue in NumPy arrays, apply masks using np.where or np.ma.masked_where, and prepare data for plotting by filtering or computing min/max values.

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
How to create a figure with two subplots using matplotlib: one with an orthographic projection map centered at lat_0=-55 and lon_0=120, showing a trajectory with coastlines, parallels at [-80,-60,-40,-20,0], and meridians every 20 degrees; the other with time vs xco2 data and a twin axis for time vs altitude. Customize both plots with appropriate labels, titles, and tick formats.
