        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            A Python script to visualize ozone (O3) data from an HDF5 file with the following specifications:

1. Import Libraries

2. Load Data:
   - Open the HDF5 file: 'TES-Aura_L2-O3-Nadir_r0000002433_F08_12.he5'.
   - Extract ozone data from 'O3' (all rows, 6th column) from the group `/HDFEOS/SWATHS/O3NadirSwath/Data Fields`.
   - Retrieve latitude and longitude from their respective paths.

3. Data Processing:
   - Extract Units, Title, and FillValue attributes.
   - Replace FillValues with NaNs in the ozone data.

4. Create Map:
   - Use Basemap with cylindrical projection, low resolution, lat limits [-90, 90], lon limits [-180, 180].
   - Draw coastlines (linewidth=0.5), parallels (every 45 degrees) from -90 to 90, 
      and meridians (every 45 degrees with labels on left and right) from -180 to 180.

5. Plot Data:
   - Scatter plot ozone data using longitude, latitude coordinates; set marker size to 1.

6. Customize Plot:
   - Add colorbar labeled with O3 Units.
   - Set title combining HDF5 filename base and O3 long_name attribute.

Okay, so I need to break down this user query into three specific sub-queries. Let me read through the user's request carefully.

The user wants a Python script that visualizes ozone data from an HDF5 file. They've outlined several steps: importing libraries, loading data, processing it, creating a map, plotting the data, and customizing the plot.

First, I'll tackle the HDF5 Dataset Access part. The user mentions opening a specific HE5 file and extracting ozone data from a particular group and column. Also, they need to retrieve latitude and longitude from their respective paths. So, the sub-query should focus on using h5py to access these datasets and attributes.

Next is NumPy-based Data Preprocessing. They want to extract units, title, and fill value attributes. Then, replace fill values with NaNs in the ozone data. This part is about handling missing data and preparing it for visualization.

Lastly, the Plotting and Visualization sub-query involves using Basemap with a cylindrical projection, setting up coastlines, parallels, meridians, and plotting the data as a scatter plot. They also need to add a colorbar and title based on attributes from the HDF5 file.

I'll make sure each sub-query is clear and targets only the specified technical domains without overlapping.

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
How to open an HE5 file 'TES-Aura_L2-O3-Nadir_r0000002433_F08_12.he5' using h5py, extract ozone data from '/HDFEOS/SWATHS/O3NadirSwath/Data Fields/O3', retrieve latitude and longitude datasets, and access attributes like Units, Title, and FillValue.

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
How to replace _FillValue in ozone data with NaNs using NumPy, extract units, title, and fill value attributes from HDF5 dataset, and process the ozone data for visualization.

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
How to create a cylindrical projection map using Basemap, draw coastlines, parallels every 45 degrees from -90 to 90, meridians every 45 degrees with labels on left and right, plot ozone data as scatter points with longitude and latitude coordinates, add colorbar labeled with O3 units, and set title combining filename base and O3 long_name attribute.
