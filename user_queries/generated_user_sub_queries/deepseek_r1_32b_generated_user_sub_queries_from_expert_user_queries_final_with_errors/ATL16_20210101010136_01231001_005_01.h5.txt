        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            1. Define a constant FILE_NAME pointing to the HDF5 file "ATL16_20210101010136_01231001_005_01.h5".

2. Open the HDF5 file in read mode and access three datasets: 
   global_grid_lat (latitude), global_grid_lon (longitude), and global_asr (main data).

3. Extract attributes:
   - units using decode('ascii', 'replace')
   - long name using decode('ascii', 'replace')
   - _FillValue

4. Convert main data to float type.

5. Replace _FillValue in the global_asr data with numpy NaN and mask data where values are NaN using numpy's masked_where.

6. Create a map using cylindrical projection, low resolution, with latitude from -90 to 90 and longitude from -180 to 180.

7. Add coastlines with line width 0.5, parallels at intervals of 30 degrees starting from -90 till 120, and meridians every 45 degrees from -180 to 180.

8. Adjust longitude values by subtracting 180 before plotting.

9. Use pcolormesh to plot data with latlon=True, using the adjusted longitude and latitude coordinates.

10. Add a colorbar below the map labeled with the main dataset's units.

11. Set the title of the map to include the HDF5 file's basename and the long_name attribute from the dataset.

Okay, so I need to break down the user's query into three specific sub-queries. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, looking at the HDF5 Dataset Access section. The user wants to open a specific HDF5 file and access certain datasets. They also mention extracting attributes like units, long name, and _FillValue. So I should focus on how to use h5py for opening files, accessing datasets by their paths, and retrieving these attributes with proper decoding.

Next, the NumPy-based Data Preprocessing part involves converting data types and handling missing values. The user wants to replace _FillValue with NaNs and then mask those using numpy's functions. I need to make sure the sub-query covers both conversion and masking steps clearly.

Lastly, for Map Plotting and Visualization, the user is using matplotlib along with basemap or cartopy. They specified a cylindrical projection, adjusting longitude values, adding coastlines, parallels, meridians, and setting up the colorbar and title correctly. I should ensure that all these elements are included in the sub-query.

I need to make sure each sub-query is concise and targets only its specific domain without overlapping with others.
