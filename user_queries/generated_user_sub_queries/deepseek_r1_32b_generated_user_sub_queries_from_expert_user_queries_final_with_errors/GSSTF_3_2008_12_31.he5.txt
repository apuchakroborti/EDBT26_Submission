        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            A Python script to visualize data from a GESDISC MEaSUREs GSSTF HDF-EOS5 grid file.

Steps:
1. Import necessary libraries: os, h5py, numpy as np, matplotlib as mpl, matplotlib.pyplot as plt, and mpl_toolkits.basemap import Basemap.
2. Read the HDF file located at 'GSSTF_3_2008_12_31.he5'.
3. Extract the 'E' dataset, including its attributes ('units' and 'long_name') using decode(), and retrieve the _FillValue attribute.
4. Preprocess data by replacing _FillValue with np.nan and create a masked array using np.masked_array with conditions based on np.isnan(data).
5. Construct longitude and latitude arrays based on the shape of the 'E' dataset since they are not provided in the file.
6. Create a cylindrical projection map with boundaries set for low resolution, latitudes from -90 to 90, and longitudes from -180 to 180.
7. Add parallels from -90 to 120 with interval of 30 degrees latitude with left labels only, 
    and meridians with the interval of 45 degree from -180 to 180 degrees longitude with bottom labels.
8. Visualize the data using pcolormesh with parameters longitude, latitude, data, and latlon=True.
9. Add a colorbar and a descriptive title to the plot.

<think>
Okay, so I need to break down this user query into three specific sub-queries. The user is asking for a Python script that visualizes data from a GESDISC MEaSUREs GSSTF HDF-EOS5 grid file. They've provided detailed steps, which I can use to identify the key areas.

First, looking at the steps, they mention using h5py to read an HDF file and extract datasets along with their attributes. That clearly falls under the HDF5 Dataset Access category. So my first sub-query should focus on accessing the 'E' dataset, including its attributes like units, long_name, and _FillValue.

Next, the preprocessing steps involve handling _FillValue by replacing it with np.nan and creating a masked array. This is all about NumPy operations, so that's the second sub-query. I need to make sure it covers how to handle missing data using NumPy functions like where or masked_where.

Lastly, the visualization part uses matplotlib and Basemap for plotting on a cylindrical projection. The user specifies adding parallels, meridians, colorbars, and titles. This is definitely about map plotting and should be the third sub-query. I'll need to include details about setting up the map with specific boundaries and labels.

I have to make sure each sub-query is clear and targets only one technical domain without overlapping. Also, I shouldn't add any explanations or code—just the sub-queries as per the format.
