        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            A Python script that performs the following tasks:

1. Import Libraries: Import the required libraries
2. Read HDF-EOS File: Open and read the HDF-EOS file named `MOP03TM-201802-L3V95.9.1.he5`.

3. Access Datasets:
   - Read the dataset located at `RetrievedSurfaceTemperatureDay` from the group `/HDFEOS/GRIDS/MOP03` and parent sub group `Data Fields`
   - Extract attributes from this dataset, including `long name`, `units`, and `fillValue`. Decode string attributes using the `decode()` method.

4. Data Preprocessing:
   - Replace values in the `RetrievedSurfaceTemperatureDay` dataset that match `_FillValue` with `NaN`.
   - Create a masked array using `numpy.ma.masked_array` to mask invalid or missing data points identified by `numpy.isnan`.

5. Retrieve Geolocation Information:
   - Extract latitude and longitude datasets from `Latitude` and `Longitude` from the group `/HDFEOS/GRIDS/MOP03/Data Fields`, 
      respectively, into variables named `x` (latitude) and `y` (longitude).
   - Generate a 2D meshgrid using `numpy.meshgrid` from the latitude and longitude data.

6. Create Basemap:
   - Set up a cylindrical projection map with low resolution.
   - Define the map boundaries with latitude ranging from -90 to 90 and longitude from -180 to 180.
   - Add coastlines with a line width of 0.5.
   - Draw parallels at -90, 91, 45(start, stop, interval) 
      and meridians with values at -180, -135, -90, -45, 0, 45, 90, 135, 180. 
      Set labels for these meridians as left and bottom.
   - Use `pcolormesh` to plot the data on the map, ensuring `latlon=True`.

7. Visualize Data:
   - Add a colorbar to the plot.
   - Label the colorbar using the `units` attribute from the dataset.

Okay, I need to break down the user's query into three specific sub-queries as per their instructions. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, looking at the HDF5 Dataset Access section. The user wants to open an HE5 file and access specific datasets and attributes. They mentioned using h5py for this. So I should focus on how to use h5py to read the file, navigate through groups like /HDFEOS/GRIDS/MOP03/Data Fields, and extract the dataset RetrievedSurfaceTemperatureDay. Also, extracting attributes such as long name, units, and fillValue is important here.

Next, for NumPy-based Data Preprocessing, the task involves handling _FillValue by replacing it with NaNs. Then, creating a masked array using numpy.ma.masked_array where isnan is true. I need to make sure this sub-query clearly states these steps without any extra details.

Lastly, the Plotting and Visualization part requires setting up a map using matplotlib or basemap. The user specified a cylindrical projection, boundaries from -90 to 90 latitude and -180 to 180 longitude, adding coastlines, parallels, meridians with specific labels, and plotting data with pcolormesh. Also, adding a colorbar labeled with the dataset's units is crucial.

I should ensure each sub-query is concise and targets only its respective domain without overlapping information.
