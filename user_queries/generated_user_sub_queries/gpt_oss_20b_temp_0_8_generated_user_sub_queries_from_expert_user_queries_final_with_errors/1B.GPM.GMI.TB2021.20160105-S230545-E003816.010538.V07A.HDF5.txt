"""
        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            A Python script that performs the following steps:

1. Open an HDF5 file in read mode using h5py and extract the dataset 'Tb' from the group `S1`, 
including its 'unit' and 'fillValue' attributes. Also, retrieve geolocation data from 'Latitude' and 'Longitude'.

2. Mask NaN values in the 'Tb' dataset using numpy's masked_where function with parameters based on numpy's isnan.

3. Create a cylindrical projection map with specific settings (low resolution, -90 to 90 latitude range, -180 to 180 longitude range etc.). 
it also adds coastlines with width 0.5, parrallels with every 45 degree from -90 to 90 degree.
After that it also add meridians to every 45 degree from -180 to 180 with left and bottom labels 

4. Plot the dataset as a scatter plot on the map using the 'jet' colormap, setting each point's size to 1.

5. Add a colorbar below the plot with padding of 10% and label it using the units extracted from the 'Tb' dataset.

6. Set the plot title by combining the HDF5 file's basename, the string "Tb", and "(nchan1=0)".

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
How to open an HDF5 file with h5py, access the dataset 'Tb' located at '/S1/Tb', retrieve its attributes 'unit' and 'fillValue', and read the 'Latitude' and 'Longitude' datasets from the same file, ensuring the file is opened in read mode and the dataset paths are correctly specified for extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5.

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
How to apply a mask to a NumPy array containing satellite brightness temperature data using np.ma.masked_where combined with np.isnan, and handle the dataset's '_FillValue' attribute to replace or mask missing values before further processing.

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
How to create a cylindrical (Plate Carrée) projection map with matplotlib and cartopy, add low‑resolution coastlines (width 0.5), draw parallels every 45° from -90° to 90° and meridians every 45° from -180° to 180° with left and bottom labels, plot the masked Tb data as a scatter plot with the 'jet' colormap and point size 1, add a colorbar below the plot with 10% padding labeled with the Tb units, and set the title using the HDF5 file basename plus "Tb (nchan1=0)".
