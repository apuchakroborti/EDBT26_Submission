"""
        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            1. Define Constants: Set `FILE_NAME` to "ATL06_20190223232535_08780212_006_02.h5".

2. Read HDF5 Data: Open the file in read mode and extract datasets for 
    `latitude` latitude data, `longitude` longitude data, and `h_li` data from  the root group `gt1l` and sub group `land_ice_segments`  
Retrieve attributes using decode() and handle fillValue.

3. Preprocess Data: Replace `FillValue` in `h_li` with NaNs and mask invalid data using numpy functions.

4. Create Map: Using an equidistant cylindrical projection map 
with low resolution and latitude and longitude values from -90 to 90 and -180 to 180 respectively. 
It also adds coastlines with linewidth of 0.5, 
parallels at -90 to 120 with interval of 30 degree, 
and meridians at -180 to 180 with interval of 45

5. Plot Data: 
The program should set scatter function with parameters of longitude, latitude, c=data, s=0.1, cmap=plt.cm.jet, edgecolors=None, and linewidth=0
Generate a scatter plot of the data with given parameters including colormap and marker size.

6. Add Colorbar and Title: Include a colorbar labeled with dataset units and set the title using the file's basename and long name.

        Note: return only the the response of sub-queries only based on the below format, not explanation, not python code, and node additional text needed
        Return format:

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
How can I use `h5py` to open a file with extensions such as `.h5`, `.H5`, `.he5`, and access the datasets `latitude`, `longitude`, and `h_li` located at the path `/gt1l/land_ice_segments/` while retrieving and decoding dataset attributes like `units` and `long_name`?

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
What are the steps to replace a dataset’s `_FillValue` with `np.nan`, apply a mask to invalid data using `np.where` or `np.ma.masked_where`, and compute basic statistics such as `min`, `max`, or a masked mean on the resulting array with NumPy?

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
How can I create an equidistant cylindrical map with `cartopy` (low resolution), add coastlines, meridians every 45°, parallels every 30°, plot a scatter of longitude, latitude, and data values with `cmap=plt.cm.jet`, `s=0.1`, and add a colorbar labeled with the dataset units and a title from the file basename and long name?
