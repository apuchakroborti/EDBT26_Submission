"""
        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            A Python script that reads an HDF5 file named `oco2_L2StdND_03949a_150330_B8100r_170916014809.h5` and generates a data visualization map. 
The script should perform the following steps:

1. Import Libraries: Include necessary libraries 
2. Define Constants: Set the constant `FILE_NAME` to the specified HDF5 file name.

3. Open HDF5 File: Open the file in read-only mode and assign it to a variable `f`.

4. Read Data:
   - Extract data from `/RetrievalResults/xco2` into a variable named `data`.
   - Retrieve the units and description of this dataset.

5. Read Geolocation Data:
   - Read latitude values from `retrieval_latitude` into a NumPy array called `latitude`, 
   - Read longitude values from `retrieval_longitude` into a NumPy array called `longitude` 
      from the group RetrievalGeometry.

6. Set Up Map Projection:
   - Use a cylindrical projection with low resolution.
   - Define latitude and longitude ranges from -90 to 90 and -180 to 180, respectively.

7. Customize Map Features:
   - Add coastlines with a line width of 0.5.
   - Draw parallels at [-90(start), 91(stop), 45(interval)] 
      and meridians with values [-180(start), 180(stop), 45(interval)], both at intervals of 45 degrees.
   - Label the map at position left and bottom

8. Create Scatter Plot:
   - Use the scatter function with parameters: longitude (`lon`), latitude (`lat`), data (`c=data`), marker size (`s=1`), colormap (`cmap=plt.cm.jet`), and no edge colors or line width.

9. Add Colorbar and Labels:
   - Include a colorbar at the bottom of the plot with format `%.1e` and 10% padding.
   - Set the label for the data using the retrieved units.

10. Display Plot: Render the final visualization.

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
How to use h5py to open an HDF5 file, access a dataset at a specific path (e.g., `/RetrievalResults/xco2`), and read its attributes such as units and description?

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
How to handle missing values in a NumPy array obtained from an HDF5 dataset using a `_FillValue` attribute, apply masks with `np.ma.masked_where`, and compute min/max or filter data accordingly?

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
How to create a cylindrical map projection with matplotlib/cartopy, plot longitude/latitude scatter points, add coastlines, parallels, meridians, and include a colorbar formatted with scientific notation (e.g., `%.1e`)?
