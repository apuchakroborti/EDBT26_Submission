"""
        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            A Python script that performs the following tasks:

1. Import necessary libraries: os, datetime, h5py, numpy as np, matplotlib.pyplot as plt, FormatStrFormatter from matplotlib.ticker, mpl_toolkits.basemap import Basemap.
2. Open an HE5 file named "MLS-Aura_L2GP-O3_v04-23-c02_2019d001.he5" in read mode.

3. Access the following datasets within the file:
   - Ozone data: "/HDFEOS/SWATHS/O3/Data Fields/L2gpValue"
   - Latitude values: "/HDFEOS/SWATHS/O3/Geolocation Fields/Latitude"
   - Pressure levels: "/HDFEOS/SWATHS/O3/Geolocation Fields/Pressure"
   - Time information: "/HDFEOS/SWATHS/O3/Geolocation Fields/Time"

4. Read ozone data from index 0 to 70 along the x-axis and all y-axis data.
5. Read latitude data from index 0 to 70.
6. Read pressure data up to index 55.
7. Extract units and title information from the ozone, latitude, and longitude datasets and also and decods the value.

8. Preprocess the data:
   - Replace _FillValue with numpy NaN.
   - Mask ozone data using masked_array where values are NaN.

9. Calculate start and end times using datetime functions relative to "1993-01-01" plus time in seconds from index 0 and 70, respectively, and format these as strings.

10. Create a pcolormesh plot with parameters: latitude, longitude, and ozone data transposed (data.T).

11. Set x-axis label using latitude title and units, and y-axis label using longitude title and units.

12. Set the plot title to include the data title concatenated with start and end times.

13. Configure the plot:
    - sets gca to plt
    - Invert the y-axis.
    - Set y-scale to log.
    - Format major ticks to display values with one decimal place.

14. Display the plot.

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:  
How to open an HE5/ HDF5 file with h5py, access datasets by their full paths (e.g., "/HDFEOS/SWATHS/O3/Data Fields/L2gpValue"), read dataset attributes such as units and title, and decode the attribute values?

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:  
How to replace a dataset’s _FillValue with np.nan, apply a masked array where values are NaN, and compute min/max or filter data using NumPy functions like np.where or np.ma.masked_where?

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:  
How to create a pcolormesh plot with matplotlib, set latitude and longitude labels using dataset titles and units, include a title with start/end times, invert the y-axis, set a logarithmic y-scale, and format major ticks to one decimal place?
