"""
        You are an assistant designed to break down a complex data science or geospatial analysis task 
        into smaller, focused sub-queries. Each sub-query must target a specific technical domain 
        so that relevant documentation, examples, or code can be retrieved using a vector database.

        Given the user query, return 3 clearly separated sub-queries:

        1. HDF5 Dataset Access:
        Focus only on `h5py` such as accessing file with extensions H5, h5, HE5, he5, HDF5, or hdf5, 
        accessing datasets or attributes, dataset paths (like `/Grid/cloudWater`), and metadata.

        2. NumPy-based Data Preprocessing:
        Focus only on how to handle `_FillValue`, apply masks using NumPy (`np.where`, `np.ma.masked_where`), and compute or filter data using `min`, `max`, or 
        other preprocessing logic.

        3. Map Plotting and Visualization:
        Focus only on how to use `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, or `cartopy` to visualize geospatial data, configure projections, draw coastlines, 
        meridians, parallels, and apply colorbars or titles.

        
        User Query:
            Create a Python script that processes an HDF5 file and generates a split-window plot with specific visualizations.

1. Import Libraries: Include os, cartopy.crs, matplotlib, matplotlib.pyplot, numpy, and datetime for handling OS functions, map projections, plotting, numerical operations, and date/time processing.

2. Define Constants: Set `FILE_NAME` to "ATL12_20190330212241_00250301_006_03.h5".

3. Open HDF5 File: Read the file in read mode and access these datasets:
   - `/gpsr/navigation/latitude`
   - `/gpsr/navigation/longitude`
   - `/atlas/pce1/background/bg_cnt_50shot_s` (main data)
   - `/atlas/pce1/background/delta_time` (time data)

4. Extract Attributes: For the bg_cnt_50shot_s dataset, read 'units' and 'long_name' attributes using decode('ascii', 'replace').

5. Create Plots:
   - First Plot (Time vs. Counts): 
     - Set figure size to 10x10.
     - Use subplot ax1 at position 2,1,1.
     - Calculate elapsed_time by subtracting the first time value from each time point.
     - Plot elapsed_time vs. main data with blue circles.
     - Label axes with time units and main data units.
     - Set title combining the file name, dataset name, and long_name.

   - Second Plot (Trajectory Map):
     - Calculate midpoint latitude (lat_m) and longitude (lon_m).
     - Use cartopy's orthographic projection centered at lat_m and lon_m.
     - Enable gridlines with labels and degrees, minutes, seconds (dms).
     - Display global features and coastlines.
     - Plot trajectory in blue, using Geodetic transformation.
     - Mark the starting point with a red circle and label "START" offset by 200 km.

6. Adjust Layout: Use tight layout with padding of 3.0 for proper spacing.

        Note: return only the the response of sub-queries only based on the below format, not explanation, not python code, and node additional text needed

        """

HDF5 Dataset Access Sub-query:
Open an HDF5 file with h5py, read datasets `/gpsr/navigation/latitude`, `/gpsr/navigation/longitude`, `/atlas/pce1/background/bg_cnt_50shot_s`, `/atlas/pce1/background/delta_time`, and extract the `units` and `long_name` attributes from `bg_cnt_50shot_s`, decoding them with `decode('ascii', 'replace')`.

NumPy Data Preprocessing Sub-query:
Use NumPy to compute elapsed time by subtracting the first element of the `delta_time` array, mask `_FillValue` entries with `np.ma.masked_where`, apply `np.where` or `np.ma.masked_where` to filter invalid data, and calculate `min` and `max` of the `bg_cnt_50shot_s` dataset for plotting.

Plotting and Visualization Sub-query:
Create a matplotlib figure with two subplots: (1) plot elapsed time vs. counts using blue circles, labeling axes with time and count units, and setting a title that includes the file name, dataset name, and long_name; (2) plot a trajectory on a cartopy orthographic projection centered at the midpoint latitude/longitude, enable gridlines with DMS labels, add global coastlines, plot the trajectory in blue, mark the starting point with a red circle offset by 200 km, and add appropriate titles and colorbars.
