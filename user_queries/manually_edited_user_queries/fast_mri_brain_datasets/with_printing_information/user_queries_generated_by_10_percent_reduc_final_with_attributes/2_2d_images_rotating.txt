A Python code that works with MRI brain data stored in an HDF5 file. Here's what I've gathered so far:

The code starts by defining two important file paths: 
`FAST_MRI_BRAIN_H5_FILE` which is located at 2_fastMRI_brain_first_10_dcm_to_h5.h5 and `FAST_MRI_BRAIN_H5_FILE_DATA_PATH` whole path is located below:
`FAST_MRI_BRAIN_ROOT/100099070170/279/fastMRI_brain_data`

Also print the below information by acessing attributes data from the from the group `FAST_MRI_BRAIN_ROOT/100099070170/279/metadata` 
`PatientAge`, `PatientBirthDate`, `PatientID`, `PatientIdentityRemoved`, `PatientName`, `PatientSex`

Next, it reads data from the HDF5 file. Specifically, it extracts two datasets: `brain_2D_data` (a 2D slice of brain data). 
Both are read into memory using slicing notation.

The code then prints information about these datasets, including their contents, types, and shapes.

After that, it rotates the brain images for better visualization. 
For instance, a 2D slice of both rows and columns from 10 to 502 of the brain data is rotated by 270 degrees counter-clockwise using scipy.ndimage and displayed with a bone colormap. 
The axis labels are turned off, and the resulting plot is displayed. The code repeats this process for the coronal plane.
