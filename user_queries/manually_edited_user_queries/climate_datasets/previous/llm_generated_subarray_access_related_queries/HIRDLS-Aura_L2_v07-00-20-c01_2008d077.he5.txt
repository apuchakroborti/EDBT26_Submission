Here's a step-by-step explanation of the Python code:

**Importing Libraries**

The code starts by importing various libraries:

* `datetime` for working with dates and times
* `os` for interacting with the operating system (e.g., getting the current working directory)
* `matplotlib` and `matplotlib.pyplot` for creating plots
* `mpl_toolkits.basemap` for creating maps (not used in this code, but imported anyway)
* `numpy` for numerical computations
* `h5py` for reading HDF5 files

**Defining Constants**

The code defines a constant `FILE_NAME` with the value `'HIRDLS-Aura_L2_v07-00-20-c01_2008d077.he5'`, which is the name of the HDF-EOS5 file to be read.

**Opening the HDF5 File**

The code opens the HDF5 file using `h5py` in read-only mode (`mode='r'`) and assigns it to a variable `f`. This creates a context manager that ensures the file is properly closed when we're done with it.

**Reading Data from the HDF5 File**

The code reads data from three datasets within the HDF5 file:

* `dset_var` corresponds to the `/HDFEOS/SWATHS/HIRDLS/Data Fields/O3` dataset, which contains ozone (O3) data.
* `dset_pres` corresponds to the `/HDFEOS/SWATHS/HIRDLS/Geolocation Fields/Pressure` dataset, which contains pressure data.
* `dset_time` corresponds to the `/HDFEOS/SWATHS/HIRDLS/Geolocation Fields/Time` dataset, which contains time data.

The code reads the entire datasets into memory using `[0,:]`, `[:]`, and `[0]`, respectively. These indexing operations extract specific parts of the datasets.

**Reading Attributes from the HDF5 File**

The code reads various attributes associated with each dataset:

* `data_units`, `pres_units`, `data_title`, `time_title`, and `pres_title` are read from the respective datasets' attributes.
* `fillvalue` is read from the `dset_var` dataset's attributes, which represents a fill value (e.g., NaN) used in the data.

**Data Processing**

The code performs some data processing:

* It replaces any occurrences of the fill value with NaN (`np.nan`) in the ozone data.
* It converts the date stored as a six-digit number (YYYYMM) into a string using `datetime`.

**Plotting**

The code creates a plot using `matplotlib`:

* It plots the ozone data against pressure using `plt.plot`.
* It customizes the x-axis tick labels to use scientific notation with a specific format.
* It sets the x-axis label, y-axis label, and title of the plot using various attributes read from the HDF5 file.

**Saving the Plot**

The code saves the plot to a PNG file with a name based on the input file name (`basename`) and appends `.py.png` to it. The `fig.savefig` method is used to save the figure.

Overall, this code reads data from an HDF-EOS5 file, processes it, and creates a plot of ozone concentration against pressure.
