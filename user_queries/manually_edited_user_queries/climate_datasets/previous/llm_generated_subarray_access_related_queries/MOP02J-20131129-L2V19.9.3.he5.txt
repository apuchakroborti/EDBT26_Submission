Here's a step-by-step explanation of the provided Python code:

**Importing Libraries**

The code starts by importing several Python libraries:

1. `os`: for interacting with the operating system (e.g., getting the current working directory)
2. `h5py`: for reading and manipulating HDF5 files
3. `matplotlib` and `matplotlib.pyplot`: for creating visualizations (plots) of data
4. `mpl_toolkits.basemap`: for creating maps using the Basemap toolkit
5. `numpy`: for numerical computations and array operations

**Defining Constants**

The code defines a constant `FILE_NAME`, which is set to the name of an HDF-EOS5 file (`MOP02J-20131129-L2V19.9.3.he5`).

**Opening the HDF File**

The code opens the specified HDF file in read-only mode using `h5py`. The `with` statement ensures that the file is properly closed when it's no longer needed.

**Accessing Data**

Within the `with` block, the code accesses several datasets within the HDF file:

1. `RetrievedSurfaceTemperature`: a 2D array of temperature values
	* The code reads the entire dataset into memory using `f[name][:, 0]`.
	* It also retrieves the units and fill value (a special value used to represent missing data) from the dataset's attributes.
2. `Latitude` and `Longitude`: 1D arrays of geographic coordinates

**Data Processing**

The code performs some basic data processing:

1. Replaces fill values with NaN (Not a Number) using NumPy's `nan` constant.

**Creating a Map**

Using Basemap, the code creates a map with the following settings:

1. Projection: cylindrical (`cyl`)
2. Resolution: low (`l`)
3. Latitude and longitude limits: -90 to 90 and -180 to 180, respectively
4. Coastlines are drawn with a line width of 0.5
5. Parallels (latitude lines) and meridians (longitude lines) are drawn at intervals of 45 degrees

**Plotting Data**

The code plots the temperature data on the map using `m.scatter`:

1. Longitude and latitude values are used as x and y coordinates, respectively.
2. The color (`c`) of each point is determined by the corresponding temperature value.
3. Point size (`s`) is set to 1.

**Adding a Colorbar**

A colorbar is added to the plot using `m.colorbar`, with the label set to the units of the temperature data.

**Saving the Plot**

The code saves the plot as a PNG file using `matplotlib.pyplot`:

1. The filename is generated by concatenating the base name of the HDF file (without extension) with `.py.png`.
2. The title of the plot includes the base name of the HDF file and a description of the plotted data.

Overall, this code reads an HDF-EOS5 file, extracts temperature and geolocation data, creates a map, plots the temperature data on the map, and saves the resulting visualization as a PNG file.
