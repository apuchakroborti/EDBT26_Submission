Here's a step-by-step explanation of the provided Python code:

**Importing Libraries**

The code starts by importing various libraries:
1. `datetime` for date and time manipulation
2. `os` for operating system-related functions (e.g., getting the current working directory)
3. `matplotlib` and `matplotlib.pyplot` for plotting and visualization
4. `mpl_toolkits.basemap` for creating maps
5. `numpy` for numerical computations
6. `h5py` for reading HDF5 files

**File Name and HDF5 File Handling**

The code defines a file name `FILE_NAME` which is an HDF5 file containing GESDISC GOSAT ACOS L2 Swath data.
The code then opens the HDF5 file in read mode (`mode='r'`) using `h5py.File`.

**Dataset Extraction and Attribute Reading**

The code extracts various datasets from the HDF5 file:
1. `/RetrievalResults/xco2` (CO2 column averaged dry air mole fraction)
2. `/SoundingGeometry/sounding_latitude_geoid` (latitude)
3. `/SoundingGeometry/sounding_longitude_geoid` (longitude)
4. `/SoundingGeometry/sounding_altitude` (altitude)
5. `/RetrievalHeader/sounding_time_tai93` (time in TAI-93 format)

The code reads the data from each dataset using slicing (`[:]`) and stores it in separate variables.
Additionally, the code reads attributes from the datasets, specifically the units of measurement for CO2 and altitude.

**Plotting**

The code creates a figure with two subplots:
1. The first subplot is an orthographic projection map showing the trajectory of the GOSAT instrument using `Basemap`.
	* It plots the coastline, parallels, and meridians.
	* It marks the starting point of the trajectory with a red circle and annotates it with "START".
2. The second subplot shows time vs. CO2 column averaged dry air mole fraction and altitude.
	* It plots the CO2 data using `plot`.
	* It creates a twin plot for altitude using `twinx` and plots the altitude data.
	* It sets labels, titles, and formats for both subplots.

**Title and File Saving**

The code generates a title string that includes the start and end times of the measurement period in TAI-93 format.
It saves the figure to a PNG file with a name based on the HDF5 file name using `fig.savefig`.

Overall, this code is designed to visualize GESDISC GOSAT ACOS L2 Swath data stored in an HDF5 file. It extracts relevant datasets, reads attributes, and plots the trajectory and CO2/altitude data.
