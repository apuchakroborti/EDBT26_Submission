A Python script that reads an HDF5 file, extracts specific datasets, processes the data, and saves it to a CSV file. Here's how it works:

The script starts by opening the HDF5 file 'OMSNO2_0.1x0.1_200501_SPv3.h5' in read mode.

It then reads three datasets from the file: '/OMI_SurfNO2', '/Longitude', and '/Latitude'. These are stored in variables named `dset`, `x`, and `y`.

Based on the Longitude and Latitude data, a meshgrid is created such as from two 1D arrays of Longitude and Latitude data it returns two 2D arrays named lon and lat

Finally, it saves the processed data to a CSV file. The filename is constructed by taking the basename of the original HDF5 file and appending '.csv'. 
The data is saved with a header row containing column names and commas as delimiters.
