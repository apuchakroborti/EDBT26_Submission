A Python code that reads an HDF-EOS5 file and plots BrO data against pressure. Here's what it does:

First, it imports necessary libraries.

Then, it defines two constants: `FILE_NAME` for the HDF-EOS5 file name and `path` for the dataset path within the file (`'/HDFEOS/SWATHS/BrO'`).

Next, it reads the HDF-EOS5 file and extracts various datasets:

* BrO data from `'/HDFEOS/SWATHS/BrO/Data Fields/BrO'`
* Pressure values from `'/HDFEOS/SWATHS/BrO/Geolocation Fields/Pressure'`
* Time values from `'/HDFEOS/SWATHS/BrO/Geolocation Fields/Time'`

The code then plots the BrO data against pressure, customizing the plot by inverting the y-axis and setting it to logarithmic scale. Finally, it saves the plot as a PNG file.
