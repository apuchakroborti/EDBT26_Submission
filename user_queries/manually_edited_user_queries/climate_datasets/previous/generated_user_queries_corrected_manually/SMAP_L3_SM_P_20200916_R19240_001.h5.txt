a Python code. Here's what it does:

**Importing Libraries and Defining Constants**

The code imports necessary libraries and defines a constant `FILE_NAME` for the HDF5 file to be read.

**Reading Data from HDF5 File**

It opens the HDF5 file, reads data from `/Soil_Moisture_Retrieval_Data_AM/soil_moisture`, retrieves attributes like units and valid range, creates a mask for invalid data, and replaces it with NaN values.

**Reading Geolocation Data**

It reads geolocation data from `/Soil_Moisture_Retrieval_Data_AM/latitude` and `/Soil_Moisture_Retrieval_Data_AM/longitude`.

**Creating a Map and Visualizing Data**

The code creates a map using Basemap, draws coastlines and parallels, scatters the data points, and adds a colorbar. 
Finally, it saves the plot as a PNG file with a title based on the HDF5 file name and dataset long name.
