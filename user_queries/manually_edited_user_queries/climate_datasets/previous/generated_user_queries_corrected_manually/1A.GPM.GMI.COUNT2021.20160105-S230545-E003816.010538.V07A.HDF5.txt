A python script that visualizes data from an HDF5 file. Here's what it does:

Step 1: Load Data

The script loads an HDF5 file and extracts several datasets:
	`/S2/solarAzimuthAngle` (solar azimuth angle)
	`/S2/Latitude` and `/S2/Longitude` (geolocation data)

Step 2: Process Solar Azimuth Angle Data

It processes the solar azimuth angle data by replacing fill values with NaN and masking NaN values.

Step 3: Create Map and Plot Data

The script creates a map, sets up its boundaries, and plots the solar azimuth angle data on it. The plot uses color mapping based on the data values.

Step 4: Add Colorbar and Title

It adds a colorbar with a label indicating the units of the data and sets a title for the plot, including the file name and dataset name.

Step 5: Save Plot to PNG File

Finally, it saves the plot to a PNG file. The file name is constructed by appending `.py.png` to the base name of the HDF5 file.
