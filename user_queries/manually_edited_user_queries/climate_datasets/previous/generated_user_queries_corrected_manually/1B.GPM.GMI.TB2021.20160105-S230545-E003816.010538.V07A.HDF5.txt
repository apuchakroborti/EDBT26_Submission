It starts by setting up some initial values: font size to 9 and a file name. 
Then it opens an HDF5 file in read mode and extracts several datasets: 
    `/S1/Tb` with its units 
    and `_FillValue`, 
    and `/S1/Latitude` 
    and `/S1/Longitude`. 

Next, it creates a cylindrical projection map with specific settings (low resolution, -90 to 90 latitude range, etc.). 
The map is customized by adding coastlines, parallels, and meridians. 

The code then plots the dataset values as a scatter plot on the map, using the `jet` colormap for color and setting point size to 1. 
A colorbar with the extracted units is added, along with a title combining the file name and other information. 
Finally, the figure is saved as a PNG image.
