The script starts by reading the file. It then accesses several datasets located at /HDFEOS/GRIDS/MOP03 within the file: 
- `/Data Fields/RetrievedSurfaceTemperatureDay`, which contains 2D surface temperature data
- `/Data Fields/Latitude`, which contains latitude values
- `/Data Fields/Longitude`, which contains longitude values

The script preprocesses the data by replacing fill values with `NaN` and creating a masked array. 

Next, it creates a map using `Basemap` library with a cylindrical projection and sets the latitude and longitude limits. It then plots the surface temperature data on the map as a scatter plot.

Finally, the script saves the plot to a PNG file by constructing the filename from the HDF-EOS file name and using the current figure to save the plot.
