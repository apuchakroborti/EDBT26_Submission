a Python script that reads an HDF5 file and creates a map visualization. Here's how it works:

**Reading HDF5 File**

The script opens the HDF5 file in read-only mode using `h5py` and assigns it to a variable.

**Extracting Data and Attributes**

It extracts various datasets and attributes from the HDF5 file, including `/lst`, which contains the data of interest. The script also extracts several attributes like scale factor, add offset, units of measurement, fill value, and long description of the dataset.

**Extracting Latitude and Longitude**

The script extracts two additional datasets: `/lon` for longitude values and `/lat` for latitude values.

**Data Processing**

It applies transformations to the data, replacing fill values with NaN, applying scale factor and add offset, and creating a masked array where NaN values are excluded.

**Creating Map Visualization**

Using `Basemap`, the script creates a cylindrical projection map with low-resolution coastlines. It draws coastlines, parallels, and meridians on the map, and creates a scatter plot of the data using the Jet colormap.

**Adding Colorbar and Title**

The script adds a colorbar to the map, sets its label to the units of measurement, and sets the title of the plot to include the base name and long description of the dataset.

**Saving Plot to File**

Finally, it saves the plot to a PNG file.
