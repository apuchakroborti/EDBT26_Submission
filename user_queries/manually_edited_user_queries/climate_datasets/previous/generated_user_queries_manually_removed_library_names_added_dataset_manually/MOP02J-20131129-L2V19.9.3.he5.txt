a Python script that reads an HDF-EOS5 swath file and creates a map with plotted data. Here's what it does:

**Importing Libraries**

The script imports necessary libraries for interacting with the operating system, reading/writing HDF5 files, creating plots/visualizations, and numerical computations.

**Defining Constants**

Two constants are defined: `FILE_NAME` (the name of the HDF-EOS5 swath file) and `units` (an empty string to be populated later).

**Reading Data**

The script opens the HDF file in read-only mode and reads data from `/HDFEOS/SWATHS/MOP02/Data Fields/RetrievedSurfaceTemperature`. It extracts units and fill values, replaces fill values with NaN, and assigns the data to `data`.

**Reading Geolocation Data**

It reads geolocation data from `/HDFEOS/SWATHS/MOP02/Geolocation Fields/Latitude` and `/HDFEOS/SWATHS/MOP02/Geolocation Fields/Longitude`, assigning them to `latitude` and `longitude`.

**Creating a Map**

The script creates a cylindrical map with low resolution, sets latitude and longitude limits, and draws coastlines, parallels, and meridians.

**Plotting Data**

It plots the `data` array on the map using a scatter plot, adds a colorbar with units as the label, and saves the plot to a PNG file named after the HDF file. Can you help me understand this script?"
