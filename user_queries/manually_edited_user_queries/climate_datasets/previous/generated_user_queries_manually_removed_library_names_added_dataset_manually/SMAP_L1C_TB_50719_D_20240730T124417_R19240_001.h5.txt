I'm working with an HDF5 file containing SMAP L1C data. Here's what I've done so far:

First, I defined the file name as "SMAP_L1C_TB_50719_D_20240730T124417_R19240_001.h5". Then, I opened the file in read mode and accessed a dataset named "/Global_Projection/cell_tb_h_fore", which contains the main data.

I also extracted attributes from this dataset, including units of measurement, long description, fill value, and valid range. I decoded these attribute values from ASCII to Unicode and identified invalid data points by checking if they're outside the valid range or equal to the fill value. These points were set to NaN (Not a Number).

Next, I accessed geolocation datasets "/Global_Projection/cell_lat" and "/Global_Projection/cell_lon", which contain latitude and longitude values respectively.

Using this data, I created a map with a cylindrical projection, drew coastlines, parallels, and meridians, and scattered the data points on the map. I also added a colorbar to represent the data values.

Finally, I saved the plot to a PNG file with the same base name as the HDF5 file, but with a ".py.png" extension.
