a Python script that reads data from two HDF5 files. Here's what it does:

First, it imports necessary libraries and defines file names and paths for the ECOSTRESS L2 and L1B GEO HDF5 files.

Then, it opens these files in read-only mode using `h5py` and reads various datasets and attributes:

* From the L2 file: "LST" dataset (land surface temperature data), scale factor, offset, units, fill value, and long name.
* From the L1B GEO file: longitude and latitude values.

The script then processes the data by replacing fill values with NaN, applying scale factors and offsets, and creating masked arrays.

Next, it creates a map projection using Basemap with Albers Equal-Area Conic (AEA) projection, low resolution, and specific bounding box parameters.

Finally, it plots the LST data on the map projection, adds coastlines, parallels, meridians, and a colorbar with units, and saves the plot to a PNG file named after the input HDF5 file.

Please note that I've kept essential details about the script's functionality, including dataset names and their parent groups within the HDF5 hierarchy.
