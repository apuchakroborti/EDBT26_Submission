"Can you explain this Python code? It starts by importing necessary libraries: `os`, `h5py`, `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, and `numpy`. 

The code then defines a constant `FILE_NAME` for the HDF5 file to be processed. It opens the file in read mode using `h5py` and accesses several datasets and attributes, including `name`, `pname`, `subset`, `data`, `pres`, `punits`, `units`, and `longname`.

It also accesses geolocation data from `/HDFEOS/SWATHS/H2O/Geolocation Fields/Latitude` and `/Longitude`. 

The code then creates a cylindrical map projection using `Basemap` and plots the H2O data on the map using `scatter`. A colorbar is created to display the units of the H2O data. 

Finally, it customizes the plot title and saves the figure to a PNG file based on the HDF5 file name."
