"I'd like to understand this Python script, which reads an HDF5 file containing climate data and creates a map visualization using Basemap and Matplotlib. 

The script starts by importing necessary modules: `os`, `h5py`, `numpy` as `np`, `matplotlib` as `mpl` and `matplotlib.pyplot` as `plt`, and `Basemap` from `mpl_toolkits.basemap`.

It then defines a constant `FILE_NAME` with the value `'MOP03T-20131129-L3V5.9.1.he5'` and opens the HDF5 file in read-only mode using `h5py`. Within the file, it accesses datasets `/HDFEOS/GRIDS/MOP03/Data Fields`, `RetrievedSurfaceTemperatureDay`, `Latitude`, and `Longitude`.

The script reads attributes associated with the `RetrievedSurfaceTemperatureDay` dataset, including `long_name`, `units`, and `_FillValue`. It then processes the data by transposing it, replacing fill values with `NaN`, and creating a masked array.

A Basemap object is created with a cylindrical projection, low-resolution coastlines, and specified latitude and longitude limits. The script plots the data using this Basemap object, adding coastlines, parallels, and meridians to the map. A colorbar is added with the label set to the units of the dataset.

Finally, the script sets the plot title using the file name and long name of the dataset, and saves the figure as a PNG file."
