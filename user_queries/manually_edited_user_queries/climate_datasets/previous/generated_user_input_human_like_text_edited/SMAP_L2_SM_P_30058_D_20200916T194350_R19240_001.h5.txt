"I'd like you to explain this Python code step-by-step. 

The code starts by importing necessary libraries: `os`, `h5py`, `matplotlib`, `Basemap`, and `numpy`. It then defines a constant `FILE_NAME` for the HDF5 file to be read.

Next, it opens the HDF5 file using `h5py` and accesses the `/Soil_Moisture_Retrieval_Data/soil_moisture` dataset. It extracts metadata attributes like units, long name, fill value, and valid range from the dataset.

The code identifies invalid data points (outside the valid range or equal to the fill value) and replaces them with NaN using NumPy's logical operations. It then creates a masked array from the data.

It also retrieves latitude and longitude datasets from the HDF5 file.

Using Basemap, the code creates a cylindrical projection map with coastlines, latitude/longitude parallels and meridians, and plots the data as a scatter plot with a colormap. A colorbar is added to the bottom of the map.

Finally, it sets up the plot title and figure, including the file name and long description of the data, and saves the figure as a PNG file based on the input file name."
