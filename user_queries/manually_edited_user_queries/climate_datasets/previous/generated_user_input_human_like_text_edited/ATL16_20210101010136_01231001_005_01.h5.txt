I need help understanding a Python code. Here's what it does:

**Importing libraries and defining constants**

The code starts by importing `os`, `matplotlib.pyplot` (as `plt`), `numpy` (as `np`), `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, and `h5py`. It also defines a constant `FILE_NAME` set to an HDF5 file name.

**Opening the HDF5 file and reading datasets**
 latitude "/global_grid_lat", longtitude "/global_grid_lon", dset_name = "/global_asr"
The code opens the HDF5 file in read-only mode using `h5py` and reads several datasets: `latvar`, `lonvar`, `datavar`, and their attributes. It also extracts arrays of values from these datasets.

**Handling FillValue and creating a map projection**

The code replaces `_FillValue` with `np.nan` and creates a masked array. Then, it creates an equidistant cylindrical projection using Basemap, drawing the coastline database, parallels, and meridians.

**Plotting the data and setting labels**

The code plots the `data` array on the map projection using `pcolormesh`, adds a colorbar, and sets labels and titles for the plot. The title combines the HDF5 file name with the decoded long name string.

**Saving the plot**

Finally, the code saves the plot to a PNG file using `fig.savefig`.

Can you help me understand this code better?
