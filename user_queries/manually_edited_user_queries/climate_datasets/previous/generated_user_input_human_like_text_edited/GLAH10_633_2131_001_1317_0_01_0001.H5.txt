"I need help understanding a Python code. Here's what it does:

The code starts by importing necessary libraries: `os`, `matplotlib` and its pyplot module, `Basemap` from `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, and `numpy`.

It defines a `run()` function that takes a file name as an argument. This function reads data from an HDF5 file using either `netCDF4` or `h5py`, depending on the value of `USE_NETCDF4`. If `True`, it uses `netCDF4`; otherwise, it uses `h5py`.

The code extracts various datasets from the HDF5 file, including latitude and longitude values, temperature data, and time values.
The paths are Geolocation/d_lat, Geolocation/d_lon, Geophysical/r_Surface_temp, Time/d_UTCTime_1
It then visualizes the data using `Basemap` to create an equidistant cylindrical projection of the Earth's surface. It draws coastlines, parallels, and meridians, and plots temperature values as a scatter plot with a colormap. The title includes the file name and long name of the temperature data.

Finally, it saves the plot as a PNG image using the base name of the HDF5 file.

Can you help me understand how this code works?"
