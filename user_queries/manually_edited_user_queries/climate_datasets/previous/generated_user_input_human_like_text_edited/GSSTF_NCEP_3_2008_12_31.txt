"I need help understanding a Python script that accesses and visualizes a GESDISC MEaSUREs GSSTF HDF-EOS5 grid file, group  HDFEOS/GRIDS/NCEP data Data Fields, and dataset SST Here's what it does:

The script imports necessary modules, including `datetime`, `os`, `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, and `numpy`. It defines a constant `USE_NETCDF4` to determine whether to use NetCDF4 or h5py to read the HDF file.

The main function `run(FILE_NAME)` reads the HDF file, extracts data, and visualizes it using Matplotlib and Basemap. Depending on `USE_NETCDF4`, it uses either NetCDF4 or h5py to read the file, navigate through the HDF hierarchy, and extract data, long name, and units.

The script creates latitude and longitude arrays based on the data shape and uses Basemap to create a map projection. It plots the data using `pcolormesh` and adds a colorbar with the units of the data. Finally, it saves the plot as a PNG file.

In the main execution, the script sets the input HDF file name, constructs the full path, and calls the `run` function with the constructed file name as an argument."
