"Can you explain this Python code? 

It starts by importing necessary modules: `os`, `h5py`, `datetime`, `numpy` (`np`), and `matplotlib` (`mpl`) and `matplotlib.pyplot` (`plt`). 

Then, it defines a constant `FILE_NAME` with the value of an HDF-EOS5 file to be read. 

The code opens this file in read-only mode using `h5py` and reads various datasets: "L2gpValue", "Latitude", "Pressure", and "Time" from specific groups within the HDF-EOS5 hierarchy.

It subsets the first 70 elements of each dataset, reads the data into variables, and extracts attributes like units and titles. 

The code handles fill values by replacing them with NaN values and creates a masked array. It converts the stored date and time into a string representation using `datetime`.

Finally, it uses `matplotlib` to create a visualization: a meshgrid from latitude and pressure data, plots the L2gpValue data, adds a colorbar, sets labels and title, and saves the plot as a PNG image."
