"I'd like an explanation of this Python code. 

The code starts by importing necessary modules, including `os`, `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, `numpy` (as `np`), and `h5py`.

It defines two constants: `FILE_NAME` for the HDF5 file to read (`DeepBlue-SeaWiFS_L2_20101210T135954Z_v004-20130525T172725Z.h5`) and `DATAFIELD_NAME` for the dataset within the HDF5 file (`aerosol_optical_thickness_550_ocean`).

The code reads the HDF5 file using `h5py`, extracts the desired datasets, and processes the data by replacing -999 values with NaN and creating a masked array.

It then uses Basemap to create an orthographic projection map, computing mean latitude and longitude values, drawing coastlines and meridians, and creating a pseudocolor plot of the data. 

Finally, it adds a colorbar and title to the plot and saves it as a PNG file using Matplotlib's `savefig` function.

Can you break this down step-by-step?"
