"Can you explain this Python code? 

It starts by importing necessary libraries: `os`, `matplotlib.pyplot` as `plt`, `numpy` as `np`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap` as `Basemap`, and `h5py`.

The code defines a constant `FILE_NAME` for the HDF5 file to be read. It then opens the file in read-only mode using `h5py` and accesses several datasets: `/global_grid_lat`, `/global_grid_lon`, and `/global_asr`. The entire datasets are read using slicing and stored in corresponding variables.

The code also accesses attributes associated with the `/global_asr` dataset, such as `units`, `long_name`, and `_FillValue`. It replaces all occurrences of `_FillValue` with `np.nan` and creates a masked array using `np.ma.masked_where`.

Next, it creates an equidistant cylindrical projection using `Basemap` and defines the projection parameters. The code then draws coastlines, parallels, and meridians on the map.

The data is plotted as a pseudocolor mesh using `pcolormesh`, and a colorbar is created with the decoded units string. Finally, the plot title is set up by combining the file name with the long description of the data values, and the figure is saved as a PNG file."
