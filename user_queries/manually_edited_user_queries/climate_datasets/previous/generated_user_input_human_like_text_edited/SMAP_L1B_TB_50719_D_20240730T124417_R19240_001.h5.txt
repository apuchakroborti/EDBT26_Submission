"I need help understanding this Python code. It starts by importing necessary modules: `os`, `matplotlib.pyplot` (as `plt`), `numpy` (as `np`), `mpl_toolkits.basemap` (as `Basemap`), and `h5py`.

The code defines a constant `FILE_NAME` for the HDF5 file to be processed. It then opens this file in read-only mode using `h5py`.

Within the HDF5 file, it accesses attributes of a dataset named `/Brightness_Temperature/tb_h_surface_corrected`, including its name, data values, units, long name, and valid range.

The code processes the dataset by creating a mask for invalid or missing data points, setting them to `NaN`, and creating a masked array. It also retrieves geolocation data from two other datasets: `/Brightness_Temperature/tb_lat` and `/Brightness_Temperature/tb_lon`.

Using `Basemap`, the code creates a map with a cylindrical projection, low resolution, and specific latitude and longitude ranges. It draws coastlines, parallels, and meridians on the map.

The dataset values are plotted on the map using `m.scatter`, with longitude and latitude values as the x- and y-axes, respectively. The color represents the dataset values, and a colormap is applied.

A colorbar is added to the plot, and the title includes the file name and long name of the dataset. Finally, the plot is saved to a PNG file using `fig.savefig`, with a filename based on the HDF5 file's base name."
