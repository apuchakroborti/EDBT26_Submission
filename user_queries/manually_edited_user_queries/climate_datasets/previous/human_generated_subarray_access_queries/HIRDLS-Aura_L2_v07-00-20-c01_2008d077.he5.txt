Python code that reads and visualizes data from an HDF-EOS5 file which is located at HIRDLS-Aura_L2_v07-00-20-c01_2008d077.he5. 

Here's what it does:

Reading the File
The code opens the HDF-EOS5 file in read-only mode and assigns it to a variable.

Accessing Datasets

It reads three datasets: 
 `/O3/dset_var` containing ozone (O3) data it read 0th index from the x-axis and all data from the y-axis of 2D data
 `/HDFEOS/GRIDS/PRES/dset_pres` containing pressure data
 `/HDFEOS/GRIDS/TIME/dset_time` containing time data, reads only 0th index of linear data

from the sub group /HDFEOS/GRIDS

Reading Data and Attributes
The code reads the data from each dataset, along with their associated attributes like units, titles, and fill values.

Data Processing
It performs some tasks:

Replaces fill values in ozone (O3) data with NaN
Converts date stored as a six-digit number to a string using `datetime`

Plotting
The code creates a plot of ozone (O3) data against pressure, customizing it with scientific notation for x-axis tick labels, log scale for the y-axis, 
inverted y-axis, and customized axis labels and title.

Saving Plot
Finally, it saves the plot to a PNG file using the same base name and location of the input data file.
