Python script that visualizes Sea Surface Temperature (SST) data from a GESDISC MEaSUREs GSSTF HDF-EOS5 grid file.

The data file location is GSSTF_NCEP_3_2008_12_31.he5

Inside python script it reads the `SST` dataset from the sub group named Data Fields and root gorup of HDFEOS.
After that it read units and long name from the SST dataset.
Similarly it also read fill value attribute data from the SST dataset and get the 0th index value

The script should check the data by comparing with fill value and assign np.nan if any match

As there is no available latitude and longitude value it should construct latitude and longitude arrays,
such as it can create scaleX and scaleY value by dividing 360.0 by data.shape of 1th index and 180.0 by data.shape of 0th index
Based on the scaleX and scaleY value it creates longitude and latitude values by using numpy arrange function
To be more specific longitude value is np.arange(data.shape[1]) * scaleX - 180 + scaleX/2
and the latitude value is np.arange(data.shape[0]) * scaleY - 90 + scaleY/2

It creates an equidistant cylindrical projection with a low-resolution coastline database, -90 to 90 latitude range, -180 to 180 longitude range using Basemap, 
and plots the SST data. It adds a colorbar with units and sets the plot title.

Finally, it saves the plot to a PNG file by extracting the basename of the input HDF-EOS file, 
creating a PNG file with the same name but with a `.py.png` extension, and saving the figure using `fig.savefig`.

The main program defines the input HDF-EOS file name, checks an environment variable `HDFEOS_ZOO_DIR`, 
appends the input file path to that directory if set, and calls the `run` function with the input file name as an argument.
