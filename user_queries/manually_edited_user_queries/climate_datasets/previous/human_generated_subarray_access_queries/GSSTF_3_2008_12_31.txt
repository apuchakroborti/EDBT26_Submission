A Python script to visualize a GESDISC MEaSUREs GSSTF HDF-EOS5 grid file. 

Here's how it works:
Reading the HDF File which is located at GSSTF_3_2008_12_31.he5

The script reads the HDF file. It navigates through the HDF hierarchy to reach the `Data Fields` group, retrieves the `E` dataset.
Then it read its attributes such as units and long name and calls the decode function. It also reads fill value attribute from the 0th index of same dataset named E 

Visualizing the Data
The script uses Basemap to create an equidistant cylindrical projection map. It draws coastlines, parallels, 
and meridians on the map, plots the data as a pseudocolor mesh, and adds a colorbar with the units of the data.

Saving the Plot
The script saves the plot to a PNG file by constructing the output file name from the input HDF file base name.

Main Program
The main program sets the input HDF file name, checks for an environment variable to construct the full path, 
and calls the `run` function with the input HDF file name as an argument.
The script assumes the input HDF file has a specific structure, with groups named `HDFEOS`, `GRIDS`, `SET1`, and `Data Fields`, and a dataset named `E` within the `Data Fields` group."
