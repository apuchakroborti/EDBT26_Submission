Python code that reads and visualizes ozone data from an HDF5 file. Here's what I've found so far:

It accesses the `/Data_Fields` group and retrieves variables for `ProfileOzone`, `Latitude`, `ProfilePressureLevels`, and `Date`.
It reads ProfileOzone 3D data as a slice of 0th index of x-axis and all from both y and z axis data from the 3 dimensiontal array
It read units and long name attribute from the above mention datasets
it access the fill value data from the profile ozone data and by comparing with fill values it set NaN value
It also acces 0th index of the Date data

Next, it processes the data by converting the date to a string and applying a log scale to the pressure levels. 
Then, it creates a contour plot of the ozone data.

The plot is customized with a colorbar, labels, titles, and a text annotation displaying the date. Finally, the code saves the plot as a PNG file.

The script uses an environment variable `HDFEOS_ZOO_DIR` to find the HDF5 file, or looks in the current working directory if it's not set. 
It then calls the `run` function with the HDF5 file path as an argument.
