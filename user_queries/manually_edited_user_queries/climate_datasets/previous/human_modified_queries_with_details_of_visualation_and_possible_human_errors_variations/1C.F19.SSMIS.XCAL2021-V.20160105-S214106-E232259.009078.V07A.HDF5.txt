The code starts by loading an HDF5 file named "1C.F19.SSMIS.XCAL2021-V.20160105-S214106-E232259.009078.V07A.HDF5" in read-only mode.

It then accesses the "/S1/Tc" dataset within the HDF5 file, it is a 3 dimensional data so take all data from x and y axis and 0th slice from z axis, 
extracting data values, units, long name, and fill value. 
The code replaces fill values with NaN, creates a masked array to ignore NaN values, and extracts geolocation data (latitude and longitude).

Next, it creates a map using Basemap with a cylindrical projection, low resolution, -90 to 90 latitude range, -180 to 180 longitude range, and sets latitude and longitude limits. 
It draws coastlines, parallels, and meridians, and plots the data as a scatter plot with a jet colormap.

Finally, it creates a plot title using the file name and dataset long name, and saves the figure to a PNG file named after the input HDF5 file.
