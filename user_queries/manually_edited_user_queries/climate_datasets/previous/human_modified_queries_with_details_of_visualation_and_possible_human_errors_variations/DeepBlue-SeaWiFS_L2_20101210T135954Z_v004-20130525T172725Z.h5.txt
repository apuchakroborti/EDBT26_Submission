a code that reads an HDF5 file and visualizes its contents. 
The code starts by importing necessary libraries.
It then defines two constants: `FILE_NAME` which is located at DeepBlue-SeaWiFS_L2_20101210T135954Z_v004-20130525T172725Z.h5 for the HDF5 file to be read, 
and `DATAFIELD_NAME` for the dataset within the HDF5 file containing the data of interest (`aerosol_optical_thickness_550_ocean`).
Next, it reads the HDF5 file using a context manager, extracting the data, latitude, and longitude coordinates. It also extracts the long name and units of the dataset as attributes.

The code prepares the data for visualization by replacing -999 values with NaN and creating a masked array.

It then creates an orthographic map projection using mean latitude and longitude coordinates, draws the coastline, adds parallels and meridians, 
and creates a pseudocolor mesh plot of the data. A colorbar is added to the plot with a label indicating the units.

Finally, the code customizes the plot by setting the title and saving it as a PNG file in the same directory of the data file.
