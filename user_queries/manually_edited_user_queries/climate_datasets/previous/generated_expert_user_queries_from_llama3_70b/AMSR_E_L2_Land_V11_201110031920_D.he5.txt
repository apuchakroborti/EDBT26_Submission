Here's a step-by-step explanation of the provided Python code:

**Step 1: Import necessary libraries**

The code starts by importing several Python libraries:
* `os`: for interacting with the operating system
* `h5py`: for working with HDF5 (Hierarchical Data Format 5) files
* `numpy` as `np`: for numerical computations and data manipulation
* `matplotlib` as `mpl` and `matplotlib.pyplot` as `plt`: for creating visualizations
* `Basemap`: a toolkit for creating maps

**Step 2: Define constants**

The code defines several constants:
* `FILE_NAME`: the name of the HDF5 file to be read (`AMSR_E_L2_Land_V11_201110031920_D.he5`)
* `DATA_NAME`: the path to the dataset within the HDF5 file (`/HDFEOS/POINTS/AMSR-E Level 2 Land Data/Data/Combined NPD and SCA Output Fields`)
* `FIELD_NAME`: the name of the specific field to be extracted from the dataset (`SoilMoistureSCA`)

**Step 3: Open the HDF5 file**

The code opens the specified HDF5 file in read-only mode using `h5py.File`. The `with` statement ensures that the file is properly closed when it's no longer needed.

**Step 4: Extract data from the HDF5 file**

Within the `with` block, the code extracts several datasets from the HDF5 file:
* `datas`: the entire dataset at the specified path (`DATA_NAME`)
* `latitude` and `longitude`: extracted from the `datas` dataset
* `data`: the specific field of interest (`FIELD_NAME`) extracted from the `datas` dataset

**Step 5: Clean up missing values**

The code replaces missing values in the `data` array with NaN (Not a Number) using the `_FillValue` constant (-9999.0). It then creates a masked array to handle these NaN values.

**Step 6: Create a map visualization**

The code uses `Basemap` to create a cylindrical projection map:
* `m`: the Basemap object
* The map is configured with various settings (e.g., resolution, latitude/longitude ranges)
* Coastlines, parallels, and meridians are drawn on the map

**Step 7: Plot the data**

The code plots the extracted `data` array on the map using `m.scatter`. The color of each point is determined by its value in the `data` array.

**Step 8: Add a colorbar and title**

A colorbar (`cb`) is added to the plot, and a title is set using the file name and field name.

**Step 9: Save the figure**

The code saves the resulting plot as a PNG image file with a name based on the input file name.

Overall, this code reads an HDF5 file containing land data from the AMSR-E instrument, extracts specific fields of interest, and visualizes them on a map using Basemap and Matplotlib.
