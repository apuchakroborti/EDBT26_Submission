Here's a step-by-step explanation of the Python code:

**Importing Libraries**

The code starts by importing several libraries:

* `os`: for operating system-related functions
* `matplotlib.pyplot` (aliased as `plt`): for plotting and visualization
* `numpy` (aliased as `np`): for numerical computations
* `mpl_toolkits.basemap` (aliased as `Basemap`): for geographic mapping and projection
* `h5py`: for working with HDF5 files

**Defining the HDF5 File**

The code defines a constant `FILE_NAME` with the name of the HDF5 file to be accessed: `"ATL20-01_20181101001332_05100101_004_01.h5"`.

**Opening the HDF5 File**

The code opens the HDF5 file in read-only mode (`mode="r"`) using `h5py`. The file is opened as a context manager, which ensures that the file is properly closed when the script finishes executing.

**Accessing Datasets**

Within the HDF5 file, the code accesses several datasets:

* `/grid_lat`: a dataset containing latitude values
* `/grid_lon`: a dataset containing longitude values
* `/monthly/mean_fb`: a dataset containing data values

The code reads the entire contents of each dataset using slicing (`[:]`).

**Handling Fill Values**

The code handles fill values in the data by:

1. Identifying the `_FillValue` attribute associated with the `datavar` dataset.
2. Replacing all occurrences of `_FillValue` in the data with `np.nan` (Not a Number).
3. Creating a masked array using `numpy.ma.masked_where`, which allows for efficient handling of missing values.

**Visualizing the Data**

The code uses `Basemap` to create a map projection and visualize the data:

1. Creates a Basemap object with a Northern Polar Stereographic (NPSTere) projection.
2. Draws coastlines, parallels, and meridians on the map.
3. Converts longitude values from 0-360° to -180° to 180° by subtracting 180°.
4. Uses `pcolormesh` to create a pseudocolor plot of the data on the map.

**Adding Colorbar and Title**

The code adds:

1. A colorbar at the bottom of the plot with a label indicating the units of the data.
2. A title to the plot, which includes the filename and long name of the dataset.

**Saving the Plot**

Finally, the code saves the plot as a PNG file using `matplotlib`'s `savefig` method. The filename is constructed by appending `.py.png` to the original HDF5 file name.

Overall, this script accesses an HDF5 file, extracts data from it, and visualizes the data on a map projection using Basemap and Matplotlib.
