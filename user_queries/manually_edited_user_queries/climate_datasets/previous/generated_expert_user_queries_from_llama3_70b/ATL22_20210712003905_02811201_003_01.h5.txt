Here's a step-by-step explanation of the provided Python code:

**Step 1: Importing necessary libraries**

The code starts by importing several Python libraries:
* `os`: for interacting with the operating system
* `matplotlib.pyplot` as `plt`: for creating visualizations (plots)
* `numpy` as `np`: for numerical computations
* `mpl_toolkits.basemap` as `Basemap`: for creating map visualizations
* `h5py`: for reading and manipulating HDF5 files

**Step 2: Defining the HDF5 file name**

The code defines a variable `FILE_NAME` with the value `"ATL22_20210712003905_02811201_003_01.h5"`, which is the name of an HDF5 file.

**Step 3: Opening the HDF5 file**

The code uses the `h5py` library to open the HDF5 file in read-only mode (`mode="r"`). The file is opened using a context manager (`with` statement), which ensures that the file is properly closed when the script finishes executing.

**Step 4: Reading latitude and longitude datasets**

The code reads two datasets from the HDF5 file:
* `latvar`: a dataset named `/gt1l/transect_lat`, which contains latitude values
* `lonvar`: a dataset named `/gt1l/transect_lon`, which contains longitude values

The `[:]` syntax is used to read the entire dataset into memory.

**Step 5: Reading inland water body type dataset**

The code reads another dataset from the HDF5 file:
* `datavar`: a dataset named `/gt1l/inland_water_body_type`, which contains data values
* The code also reads attributes associated with this dataset, such as `units`, `long_name`, and `_FillValue`

**Step 6: Handling FillValue**

The code handles the `_FillValue` attribute by replacing it with NaN (Not a Number) values in the data array. This is done to avoid plotting issues.

**Step 7: Creating a map visualization**

The code creates a map visualization using `Basemap`. The map is an equidistant cylindrical projection with a low-resolution coastline database.
* The code sets up the map boundaries and draws coastlines, parallels, and meridians.
* It then scatters the latitude and longitude values on the map, coloring them according to the inland water body type data.

**Step 8: Adding a colorbar**

The code adds a colorbar to the map visualization using `m.colorbar`. The colorbar is labeled with the units of the dataset.

**Step 9: Setting up the plot title**

The code sets up the plot title by combining the file name, dataset name, and long name of the dataset.

**Step 10: Saving the plot as a PNG image**

Finally, the code saves the plot as a PNG image using `fig.savefig`. The image is named based on the HDF5 file name.
