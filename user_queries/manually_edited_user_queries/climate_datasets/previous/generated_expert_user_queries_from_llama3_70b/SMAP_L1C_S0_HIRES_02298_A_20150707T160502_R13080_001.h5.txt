Here's a step-by-step explanation of the provided Python code:

**Importing Libraries**

The code starts by importing several libraries:

* `os`: for operating system-related functions
* `h5py`: for working with HDF5 files
* `numpy` (as `np`): for numerical computations
* `matplotlib` (as `mpl`) and `matplotlib.pyplot` (as `plt`): for plotting and visualization
* `Basemap`: a toolkit for creating maps

**Defining Constants**

The code defines several constants:

* `FILE_NAME`: the name of the HDF5 file to be read, which is `'SMAP_L1C_S0_HIRES_02298_A_20150707T160502_R13080_001.h5'`

**Reading HDF5 File**

The code uses the `h5py` library to read the HDF5 file. It opens the file in read-only mode (`mode='r'`) and assigns it to a variable `f`.

**Accessing Data**

The code accesses several datasets within the HDF5 file:

* `/Sigma0_Data/cell_sigma0_hh_fore`: a dataset containing sigma0 data
	+ The code reads the entire dataset into memory using `f[name][:]`
	+ It extracts metadata from the dataset, such as:
		- `units`: the units of the data (in this case, `'None'`)
		- `longname`: the long name of the dataset (decoded from ASCII with replacement characters)
		- `_FillValue`: the fill value for invalid data
		- `valid_max` and `valid_min`: the valid maximum and minimum values for the data

**Data Processing**

The code processes the sigma0 data:

* It identifies invalid data by checking if the values are outside the valid range or equal to the fill value
* It replaces invalid data with NaN (Not a Number) values using NumPy's `logical_or` function
* It masks the NaN values using NumPy's `masked_where` function

**Geolocation Data**

The code accesses two more datasets:

* `/Sigma0_Data/cell_lat`: latitude data
* `/Sigma0_Data/cell_lon`: longitude data

It reads these datasets into memory using `f[...][:]`

**Plotting**

The code uses the `Basemap` toolkit to create a map:

* It creates a cylindrical projection map with a resolution of 'l'
* It sets the map boundaries and draws coastlines, parallels, and meridians
* It scatters the longitude and latitude data on the map using the sigma0 data as colors
* It adds a colorbar to the map

**Plot Customization**

The code customizes the plot:

* It sets the title of the plot to include the file name and long name of the dataset
* It saves the plot to a PNG file with a name based on the input file name

Note that the `plt.show()` function is commented out, which means the plot will not be displayed interactively. Instead, it will be saved to a file.
