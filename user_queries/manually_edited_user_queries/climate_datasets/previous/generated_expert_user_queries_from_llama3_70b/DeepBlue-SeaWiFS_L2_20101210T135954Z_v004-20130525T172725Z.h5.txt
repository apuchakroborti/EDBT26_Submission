Here's a step-by-step explanation of the provided Python code:

**Importing Libraries**

The code starts by importing various libraries:
1. `os`: for operating system-specific functionality.
2. `matplotlib` and `matplotlib.pyplot` (imported as `mpl` and `plt`): for data visualization.
3. `Basemap` from `mpl_toolkits.basemap`: for creating maps.
4. `numpy` (imported as `np`): for numerical computations.
5. `h5py`: for working with HDF5 files.

**Defining Constants**

The code defines two constants:
1. `FILE_NAME`: the name of the HDF5 file to be read, which is 'DeepBlue-SeaWiFS_L2_20101210T135954Z_v004-20130525T172725Z.h5'.
2. `DATAFIELD_NAME`: the name of the dataset within the HDF5 file that contains the data of interest, which is 'aerosol_optical_thickness_550_ocean'.

**Reading HDF5 File**

The code opens the specified HDF5 file in read-only mode (`mode='r'`) using `h5py`. It then extracts the following datasets:
1. `data`: the aerosol optical thickness data from the dataset named `DATAFIELD_NAME`.
2. `latitude` and `longitude`: the latitude and longitude coordinates associated with the data.

**Extracting Attributes**

The code extracts two attributes from the `DATAFIELD_NAME` dataset:
1. `long_name`: a string attribute that contains a brief description of the dataset.
2. `units`: a string attribute that specifies the units of measurement for the dataset.

Since these attributes are stored as bytes in HDF5 files, they need to be decoded to UTF-8 using the `.decode()` method (specific to Python 3.x).

**Data Preprocessing**

The code performs two operations on the data:
1. Replaces all instances of -999 with `NaN` (Not a Number) values.
2. Creates a masked array using `numpy.ma.masked_array`, which allows for efficient handling of missing or invalid data.

**Map Visualization**

The code creates an orthographic projection map using `Basemap`:
1. Calculates the mean latitude and longitude coordinates (`lat_m` and `lon_m`) to center the map.
2. Creates a `Basemap` object with the specified projection, resolution, and center coordinates.
3. Draws coastlines, parallels, and meridians on the map.
4. Plots the data as a pseudocolor mesh using `pcolormesh`, specifying that the longitude and latitude coordinates are in a geographic (lat/lon) coordinate system.

**Colorbar and Plot Customization**

The code:
1. Creates a colorbar (`cb`) for the plot and sets its label to include the units of measurement.
2. Sets the title of the plot using the file name and long name attributes.

**Saving the Plot**

Finally, the code saves the plot as a PNG file using `matplotlib`'s `savefig` method:
1. Gets the current figure object (`gcf`) using `plt`.
2. Constructs the file name for the PNG file by appending '.py.png' to the base name of the HDF5 file.
3. Saves the plot to the specified file.

**Program Perspective**

The program's perspective is to visualize aerosol optical thickness data from a SeaWiFS L2 swath file in HDF5 format using Python and its associated libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and mapping.
