Here's a step-by-step explanation of the provided Python code:

**Importing Libraries**

The code starts by importing several libraries:

1. `os`: for working with operating system-related tasks, such as file paths.
2. `h5py`: a library for reading and writing HDF5 files in Python.
3. `numpy` (as `np`): a library for numerical computations.
4. `matplotlib` (as `mpl`) and `matplotlib.pyplot` (as `plt`): libraries for creating visualizations.
5. `Basemap`: a library for creating maps.

**Defining Constants**

The code defines two constants:

1. `FILE_NAME`: the name of the HDF5 file to be read, which is `'oco2_L2StdND_03949a_150330_B8100r_170916014809.h5'`.

**Reading the HDF5 File**

The code opens the HDF5 file in read mode (`mode='r'`) using `h5py.File`. The file object is assigned to `f`.

**Extracting Data**

The code extracts several datasets from the HDF5 file:

1. `/RetrievalResults/xco2`: a dataset containing data with units and a long name.
	* `data`: the actual data values are extracted using `f[name][:]`.
	* `units`: the units of the data are extracted from the attributes of the dataset using `f[name].attrs['Units'][0]`.
	* `longname`: the long name (description) of the dataset is extracted from the attributes using `f[name].attrs['Description'][0]`.
2. `/RetrievalGeometry/retrieval_latitude` and `/RetrievalGeometry/retrieval_longitude`: datasets containing geolocation data.
	* `latitude` and `longitude`: the actual data values are extracted using `f[...][:]`.

**Creating a Map**

The code creates a map using `Basemap`:

1. A cylindrical projection (`projection='cyl'`) is used with a resolution of `'l'`.
2. The map boundaries are set to `-90` and `90` for latitude, and `-180` and `180` for longitude.
3. Coastlines are drawn using `m.drawcoastlines`.
4. Parallels (latitude lines) and meridians (longitude lines) are drawn using `m.drawparallels` and `m.drawmeridians`, respectively.

**Visualizing the Data**

The code visualizes the data on the map:

1. A scatter plot is created using `m.scatter`, where each point represents a data value.
	* The x-axis values are `longitude`, and the y-axis values are `latitude`.
	* The color of each point is determined by the corresponding `data` value, using a jet colormap (`cmap=plt.cm.jet`).
2. A colorbar is added to the map using `m.colorbar`, with a label set to the units of the data.

**Saving the Plot**

The code saves the plot to a PNG file:

1. The base name of the HDF5 file is extracted using `os.path.basename`.
2. The plot title is set to include the base name and long name of the dataset.
3. The figure object (`fig`) is saved to a PNG file with the same base name as the HDF5 file, but with a `.py.png` extension.

That's it!
