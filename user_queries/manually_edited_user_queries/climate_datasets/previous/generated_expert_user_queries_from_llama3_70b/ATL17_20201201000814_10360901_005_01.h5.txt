Here's a step-by-step explanation of the Python code:

**Importing necessary libraries**

The code starts by importing several Python libraries:

1. `os`: for interacting with the operating system (e.g., getting the current working directory)
2. `matplotlib.pyplot` as `plt`: for creating visualizations
3. `numpy` as `np`: for numerical computations
4. `mpl_toolkits.basemap` as `Basemap`: for creating maps
5. `h5py`: for interacting with HDF5 files

**Defining constants and file names**

The code defines several constants:

1. `FILE_NAME`: the name of the HDF5 file to be read, which is "ATL17_20201201000814_10360901_005_01.h5"

**Reading the HDF5 file**

The code opens the HDF5 file in read mode (`mode="r"`) using the `h5py` library. The file is opened as a context manager, ensuring that it is properly closed when the script finishes executing.

Within the `with` block, the code accesses several datasets within the HDF5 file:

1. `/global_grid_lat`: a dataset containing latitude values
2. `/global_grid_lon`: a dataset containing longitude values
3. `/global_asr`: a dataset containing data values

For each dataset, the code reads the entire array of values using slicing (`[:]`).

**Extracting metadata**

The code extracts metadata from the `/global_asr` dataset:

1. `units`: the units of the data values
2. `long_name`: a descriptive name for the data values
3. `_FillValue`: a special value indicating missing or invalid data

**Handling FillValue and NaN values**

The code replaces all instances of `_FillValue` in the data array with `NaN` (Not a Number) values using NumPy's broadcasting capabilities.

Then, it creates a masked array (`np.ma.masked_where`) to ignore any NaN values when plotting the data.

**Creating a map visualization**

The code uses the `Basemap` library to create an equidistant cylindrical projection of the Earth:

1. It sets up the map projection with various parameters (e.g., resolution, latitude/longitude ranges)
2. It draws coastlines, parallels, and meridians on the map
3. It plots the data values as a pseudocolor mesh (`m.pcolormesh`) using the longitude and latitude arrays

**Adding a colorbar and title**

The code adds a colorbar to the plot with a label indicating the units of the data values.

It also sets a title for the plot, which includes the file name and a descriptive name for the data values.

**Saving the plot as a PNG image**

Finally, the code saves the plot as a PNG image using `matplotlib`'s `savefig` method. The file name is constructed by appending ".py.png" to the base name of the HDF5 file.
