Here's a step-by-step explanation of the provided Python code:

**Step 1: Importing necessary libraries**

The code starts by importing several Python libraries:

* `os`: for working with operating system-related functions
* `matplotlib.pyplot` (aliased as `plt`): for creating visualizations and plots
* `numpy` (aliased as `np`): for numerical computations and data manipulation
* `mpl_toolkits.basemap` (imported as `Basemap`): for creating maps and geographic visualizations
* `h5py`: for working with HDF5 files

**Step 2: Defining constants**

The code defines a constant `FILE_NAME` that specifies the name of the HDF5 file to be read. In this case, it's an ICESat-2 ATL09 L3A version 6 HDF5 file named `ATL09_20181117090604_07600101_006_02.h5`.

**Step 3: Opening and reading the HDF5 file**

The code opens the specified HDF5 file in read mode (`mode='r'`) using the `h5py` library. The file is assigned to a variable `f`. This allows the code to access the contents of the HDF5 file.

**Step 4: Extracting data from the HDF5 file**

The code extracts several datasets from the HDF5 file:

* `latitude`: extracted from the `/profile_1/high_rate/latitude` dataset
* `longitude`: extracted from the `/profile_1/high_rate/longitude` dataset
* `temp`: extracted from the `/profile_1/high_rate/apparent_surf_reflec` dataset

For each dataset, the code also extracts additional metadata:

* `lat_vr`: valid range for latitude (minimum and maximum values)
* `lon_vr`: valid range for longitude (minimum and maximum values)
* `units`: units of measurement for the `temp` dataset
* `long_name`: long name of the `temp` dataset

**Step 5: Creating a map projection**

The code creates an equidistant cylindrical projection using the low-resolution coastline database from the `Basemap` library. This sets up a map projection that will be used to visualize the data.

**Step 6: Drawing the map and plotting the data**

The code draws several elements on the map:

* Coastlines: drawn with a line width of 0.5
* Parallels: drawn at intervals of 30° from -90° to 120° latitude
* Meridians: drawn at intervals of 45° from -180° to 180° longitude

The code then plots the `temp` data on the map using a scatter plot, where each point is colored according to its value. The points are plotted with a size of 1 and no edge colors.

**Step 7: Adding a colorbar and title**

The code adds a colorbar to the plot, which displays the units of measurement for the `temp` dataset. It also sets the title of the plot to include the file name and long name of the `temp` dataset.

**Step 8: Saving the plot to a PNG file**

Finally, the code saves the plot to a PNG file with a filename constructed by appending `.py.png` to the base name of the HDF5 file.
