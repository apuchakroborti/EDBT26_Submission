Here's a step-by-step explanation of the Python code:

**Importing Libraries**

The code starts by importing several libraries:

1. `os`: for interacting with the operating system (e.g., getting the current working directory)
2. `matplotlib` and `matplotlib.pyplot`: for creating visualizations
3. `mpl_toolkits.basemap`: for creating maps
4. `numpy`: for numerical computations
5. `h5py`: for reading HDF5 files

**Defining Constants**

The code defines a constant `FILE_NAME`, which is the name of the HDF5 file to be read.

**Opening the HDF5 File**

The code opens the HDF5 file using `h5py.File` in read-only mode (`mode='r'`). The file object is assigned to `f`.

**Reading Data from HDF5 File**

The code reads several datasets from the HDF5 file:

1. `/lat`: latitude values, stored in `latitude`
2. `/lon`: longitude values, stored in `longitude`
3. `/smap_spd`: a dataset with name `smap_spd`, which contains the main data to be visualized

For each dataset, the code reads the entire array of values using `[:]`.

**Handling Fill Values**

The code handles fill values (i.e., missing or invalid data) by:

1. Replacing fill values with NaN (Not a Number) using `data[data == _FillValue] = np.nan`
2. Creating a masked array using `np.ma.masked_where` to ignore NaN values during visualization

**Creating the Map**

The code creates an equidistant cylindrical projection map using `Basemap`:

1. Defines the map projection and resolution
2. Sets the latitude and longitude limits
3. Draws coastlines, parallels, and meridians on the map

**Visualizing Data**

The code visualizes the data on the map using `m.scatter`:

1. Plots the data points using longitude and latitude values as coordinates
2. Colors the points based on their values using a jet colormap
3. Adds a colorbar to the plot with a label indicating the units of the data

**Adding Title and Saving the Plot**

The code adds a title to the plot, which includes the file name and long name of the dataset. Finally, it saves the plot as a PNG image file using `fig.savefig`.

Overall, this code reads an HDF5 file containing SMAP L2B data, extracts the latitude, longitude, and main data values, handles fill values, creates a map, visualizes the data on the map, and saves the plot as an image file.
