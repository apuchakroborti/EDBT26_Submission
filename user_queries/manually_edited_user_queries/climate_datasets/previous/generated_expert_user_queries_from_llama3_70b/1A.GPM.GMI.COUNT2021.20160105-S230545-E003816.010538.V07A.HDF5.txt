Here's a step-by-step explanation of the provided Python code:

**Importing Libraries**

The code starts by importing several libraries:

1. `os`: for interacting with the operating system (e.g., getting the current working directory)
2. `matplotlib` and `matplotlib.pyplot`: for creating visualizations
3. `numpy`: for numerical computations
4. `mpl_toolkits.basemap`: for creating maps
5. `h5py`: for reading HDF5 files

**Setting Font Size**

The code reduces the font size to 9 points because the file name is long.

**Defining File Name and Opening HDF5 File**

The code defines a variable `FILE_NAME` with the path to an HDF5 file: `"1A.GPM.GMI.COUNT2021.20160105-S230545-E003816.010538.V07A.HDF5"`. The file is then opened in read-only mode (`mode="r"`) using the `h5py` library.

**Reading Data from HDF5 File**

The code reads data from the HDF5 file:

1. It accesses a dataset named `/S2/solarAzimuthAngle` and reads its contents into an array `data`.
2. It retrieves the units of the dataset from its attributes (`attrs["units"]`) and decodes them.
3. It retrieves the fill value of the dataset from its attributes (`attrs["_FillValue"]`) and replaces it with NaN (Not a Number) values in the data array.
4. It creates a masked array `data` to handle NaN values.

**Getting Geolocation Data**

The code reads geolocation data from the HDF5 file:

1. It accesses datasets named `/S2/Latitude` and `/S2/Longitude` and reads their contents into arrays `latitude` and `longitude`.

**Creating Map Visualization**

The code creates a map visualization using `Basemap`:

1. It defines a Basemap object `m` with a cylindrical projection, low resolution, and a global extent (-90 to 90 latitude, -180 to 180 longitude).
2. It draws coastlines, parallels, and meridians on the map.
3. It scatters the geolocation data (longitude and latitude) on the map, coloring each point by the corresponding value in the `data` array.

**Adding Colorbar and Title**

The code adds a colorbar to the map:

1. It creates a colorbar object `cb` at the bottom of the figure.
2. It sets the label of the colorbar to the units of the dataset.

It also adds a title to the figure:

1. It gets the base name of the HDF5 file using `os.path.basename`.
2. It formats the title with the base name and the dataset name (`/S2/solarAzimuthAngle`).

**Saving Figure**

Finally, the code saves the figure as a PNG file:

1. It gets the current figure object using `plt.gcf()`.
2. It saves the figure to a file named `<basename>.py.png`, where `<basename>` is the base name of the HDF5 file.

Overall, this code reads data from an HDF5 file, creates a map visualization, and adds a colorbar and title before saving the figure as a PNG file.
