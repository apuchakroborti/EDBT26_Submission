Here's a step-by-step explanation of the provided Python code:

**Importing Libraries**

The code starts by importing various libraries needed for the script to run:
1. `os`: For interacting with the operating system, particularly for file handling.
2. `h5py`: A library for reading and writing HDF5 files in Python.
3. `datetime`: For working with dates and times.
4. `numpy as np`: A library for efficient numerical computations (imported as `np`).
5. `matplotlib as mpl` and `matplotlib.pyplot as plt`: Libraries for creating visualizations (plots, charts, etc.).
6. `mpl_toolkits.basemap`: A toolkit for creating maps with Matplotlib.
7. `matplotlib.ticker`: For customizing the formatting of axis tick labels.

**Defining Constants**

The script defines a constant `FILE_NAME` which is the name of the HDF5 file to be read.

**Reading HDF5 File**

The code then opens the specified HDF5 file in read-only mode (`'r'`) using `h5py`. The file object is assigned to `f`.

**Accessing Datasets**

Four datasets are accessed from the HDF5 file:
1. `/SCIENCE_DATA/ProfileO3Retrieved` (ozone zonal average data)
2. `/GEOLOCATION_DATA/Latitude` (latitude values)
3. `/ANCILLARY_DATA/PressureLevels` (pressure levels)
4. `nTimes` (time values)

**Reading Data and Attributes**

The code reads the data from each dataset using slicing (`[:]`). It also reads various attributes associated with each dataset, such as units, valid minimum and maximum values, fill values, and long names.

**Data Processing**

1. The ozone data is masked to remove invalid or fill values.
2. The latitude values are sorted in ascending order since they're not monotonic.
3. The time values are converted from seconds since 1993-01-01 to datetime objects using `datetime`.

**Plotting**

The script creates a contour plot of the ozone data using `plt.contourf`. The x-axis represents latitude, and the y-axis represents pressure levels. The colorbar is labeled with the units of the ozone data.

**Customizing Plot**

1. Axis labels are set using `plt.xlabel` and `plt.ylabel`.
2. A title is added to the plot using `plt.title`, which includes the file name and long name of the ozone data.
3. A text box is added to display the start and end times of the data.
4. The y-axis is inverted to put high pressure at the bottom.
5. A log scale is applied to the y-axis for better visualization.
6. Scientific notation is removed from the y-axis tick labels using `FormatStrFormatter`.

**Saving Plot**

Finally, the script saves the plot as a PNG file with a name derived from the HDF5 file name.

Overall, this script reads an HDF5 file containing ozone zonal average data and creates a contour plot of the data, customizing the plot to better visualize the information.
