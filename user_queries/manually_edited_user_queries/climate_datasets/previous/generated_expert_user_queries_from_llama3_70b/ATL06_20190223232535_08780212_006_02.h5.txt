Here's a step-by-step explanation of the provided Python code:

**Importing Libraries**

The code starts by importing several libraries:

1. `os`: for operating system-related functions
2. `matplotlib.pyplot` as `plt`: for creating plots and visualizations
3. `numpy` as `np`: for numerical computations
4. `mpl_toolkits.basemap` as `Basemap`: for creating maps and projections
5. `h5py`: for working with HDF5 files

**Defining Constants**

The code defines a constant `FILE_NAME` which is the name of the HDF5 file to be read.

**Opening the HDF5 File**

The code opens the HDF5 file in read mode (`mode='r'`) using the `h5py` library. The file is opened within a `with` statement, which ensures that the file is properly closed when it's no longer needed.

**Accessing Datasets**

Within the `with` block, the code accesses several datasets from the HDF5 file:

1. `/gt1l/land_ice_segments/latitude`: latitude values
2. `/gt1l/land_ice_segments/longitude`: longitude values
3. `/gt1l/land_ice_segments/h_li`: land ice height values

For each dataset, the code reads the data into a NumPy array using the `[:]` syntax.

**Handling Fill Values**

The code handles fill values (i.e., missing or invalid data) by replacing them with NaN (Not a Number) values. It then creates a masked array using `np.ma.masked_where` to ignore these NaN values in subsequent operations.

**Creating a Map Projection**

The code creates an equidistant cylindrical projection using the Basemap library, which is a toolkit for creating maps and projections. The projection is set up with the following parameters:

* `projection='cyl'`: equidistant cylindrical projection
* `resolution='l'`: low resolution coastline database
* `llcrnrlat=-90` and `urcrnrlat=90`: latitude range
* `llcrnrlon=-180` and `urcrnrlon=180`: longitude range

**Plotting the Data**

The code plots the land ice height data using the Basemap library. The plot is created with the following parameters:

* `m.scatter`: scatter plot of longitude vs. latitude
* `c=data`: color values for each point (i.e., land ice height)
* `s=1`: marker size
* `cmap=plt.cm.jet`: colormap for the data
* `edgecolors=None`: no edge colors for the markers
* `linewidth=0`: no line width for the markers

**Adding Coastlines and Gridlines**

The code adds coastlines, parallels, and meridians to the map using the Basemap library.

**Creating a Colorbar**

The code creates a colorbar using the `m.colorbar()` function. The colorbar is labeled with the units of the land ice height data.

**Saving the Plot**

Finally, the code saves the plot as a PNG file using the `fig.savefig()` method. The filename is constructed by appending `.py.png` to the basename of the HDF5 file.

Overall, this code reads an HDF5 file containing land ice height data, plots the data on a map using Basemap, and saves the resulting image as a PNG file.
