Here's a step-by-step explanation of the provided Python code:

**Importing Libraries**

The code starts by importing necessary libraries:
1. `os`: for operating system-related functions.
2. `matplotlib.pyplot` as `plt`: for creating plots and visualizations.
3. `numpy` as `np`: for numerical computations and array operations.
4. `mpl_toolkits.basemap` as `Basemap`: for creating map projections and visualizations.
5. `h5py`: for working with HDF5 files.

**Defining Constants**

The code defines a constant `FILE_NAME`, which is the name of the HDF5 file to be read: `"3A-MO.GPM.GMI.GRID2021R1.20140701-S000000-E235959.07.V07A.HDF5"`.

**Reading HDF5 File**

The code opens the HDF5 file in read mode (`mode="r"`) using `h5py.File`. The file object is assigned to `f`.

**Accessing Dataset**

Within the HDF5 file, the code accesses a dataset named `/Grid/cloudWater` and assigns it to `name`. It then reads the data from this dataset into a NumPy array `data`, taking only the first slice (`[0, :, :]`) of the 3D array.

**Retrieving Attributes**

The code retrieves two attributes from the dataset:
1. `units`: the units of the data, decoded from bytes to string using `.decode()`.
2. `_FillValue`: a special value indicating missing or fill values in the data.

**Data Processing**

The code replaces all instances of `_FillValue` with `NaN` (Not a Number) values in the `data` array using NumPy's broadcasting and indexing capabilities. It then creates a masked array `data` using `np.ma.masked_where`, which masks out NaN values.

**Constructing Geolocation Data**

Since there is no geolocation data in the HDF5 file, the code constructs it manually:
1. `lon`: an array of longitude values from -180 to 180 degrees, with a step size of 0.25 degrees.
2. `lat`: an array of latitude values from -90 to 90 degrees, with a step size of 0.25 degrees.

**Creating Map Visualization**

The code creates a map visualization using `Basemap`:
1. It defines the map projection and boundaries.
2. It draws coastlines, parallels, and meridians on the map.
3. It plots the `data` array as a pseudocolor mesh on the map using `m.pcolormesh`.
4. It adds a colorbar with a label set to the units of the data.

**Saving Plot**

The code saves the plot to a PNG file:
1. It gets the base name of the HDF5 file using `os.path.basename`.
2. It sets the title of the plot to include the base name and dataset name.
3. It retrieves the current figure object using `plt.gcf()`.
4. It saves the figure to a PNG file with a name constructed by appending `.py.png` to the base name.

Note that the last line, `plt.show()`, is commented out, which means the plot will not be displayed immediately when running the script. Instead, it will be saved to a file.
