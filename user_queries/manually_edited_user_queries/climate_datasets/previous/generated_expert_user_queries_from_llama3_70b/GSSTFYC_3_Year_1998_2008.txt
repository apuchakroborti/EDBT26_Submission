Here's a step-by-step explanation of the provided Python code:

**Importing Libraries**

The code starts by importing various libraries:

1. `datetime`: A built-in Python library for working with dates and times.
2. `os`: A built-in Python library for interacting with the operating system.
3. `matplotlib` and `matplotlib.pyplot`: Libraries for creating visualizations (plots, charts, etc.).
4. `mpl_toolkits.basemap`: A toolkit for creating maps using Matplotlib.
5. `numpy`: A library for efficient numerical computations.

**Defining Constants**

The code defines a constant `USE_NETCDF4` set to `True`. This determines which library will be used to read the HDF file: NetCDF4 or h5py.

**Defining the `run` Function**

The `run` function takes a single argument, `FILE_NAME`, which is the path to an HDF file. The function does the following:

1. **Reading the HDF File**: Depending on the value of `USE_NETCDF4`, the code uses either NetCDF4 or h5py to read the HDF file.
	* If `USE_NETCDF4` is `True`, it uses NetCDF4 to open the file and access its contents.
	* If `USE_NETCDF4` is `False`, it uses h5py to open the file in read-only mode (`mode='r'`) and access its contents.
2. **Accessing Data**: The code accesses a dataset called "SST" (Sea Surface Temperature) within the HDF file. It retrieves the data values, long name, and units from the dataset.
3. **Applying Fill Value**: If using h5py, the code applies the fill value to the data by replacing it with `np.nan` (Not a Number).
4. **Creating Latitude and Longitude Arrays**: The code creates arrays for latitude and longitude based on the shape of the data array.

**Visualizing Data**

The code then visualizes the data using Matplotlib and Basemap:

1. **Creating a Map Projection**: It creates an equidistant cylindrical projection using Basemap.
2. **Drawing Coastlines and Gridlines**: The code draws coastlines, parallels, and meridians on the map.
3. **Rendering the Image**: It renders the SST data as a pseudocolor image in the projected coordinate system.
4. **Adding Colorbar and Title**: The code adds a colorbar with units and a title to the plot.

**Saving the Plot**

Finally, the code saves the plot as a PNG file using Matplotlib's `savefig` method.

**Main Program**

The main program sets the HDF file name to `'GSSTFYC.3.Year.1988_2008.he5'`. It then checks if an environment variable `HDFEOS_ZOO_DIR` is set, and if so, uses it to construct the full path to the HDF file. Finally, it calls the `run` function with the HDF file name as an argument.

**Program Perspective**

The program's perspective is to read an HDF file containing Sea Surface Temperature (SST) data, visualize it using Matplotlib and Basemap, and save the plot as a PNG file. The program assumes that the HDF file has a specific structure, with the SST dataset located within a group hierarchy.
