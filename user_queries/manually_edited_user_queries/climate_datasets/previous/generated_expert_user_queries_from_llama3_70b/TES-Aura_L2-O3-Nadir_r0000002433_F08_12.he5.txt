Here's a step-by-step explanation of the provided Python code:

**Importing Libraries**

The code starts by importing several libraries:

1. `os`: for interacting with the operating system (e.g., getting the current working directory)
2. `h5py`: for reading and manipulating HDF5 files
3. `numpy` (`np`): for numerical computations and data manipulation
4. `matplotlib` (`mpl`) and `matplotlib.pyplot` (`plt`): for creating visualizations
5. `Basemap` (from `mpl_toolkits.basemap`): for creating maps

**Defining Constants**

The code defines a constant `FILE_NAME`, which is the name of the HDF-EOS5 Swath file to be read.

**Reading HDF File**

The code opens the HDF file in read mode (`mode='r'`) using `h5py`. The file object is assigned to `f`.

**Extracting Data**

The code extracts several datasets from the HDF file:

1. `/HDFEOS/SWATHS/O3NadirSwath/Data Fields/O3`: This dataset contains ozone (O3) data.
	* `data` is extracted as a 2D array, taking only the 6th column (`[:, 5]`) of the dataset.
	* `units`, `longname`, and `fillvalue` are extracted from the dataset's attributes.
2. `/HDFEOS/SWATHS/O3NadirSwath/Geolocation Fields/Latitude`: This dataset contains latitude data.
	* `latitude` is extracted as a 1D array.
3. `/HDFEOS/SWATHS/O3NadirSwath/Geolocation Fields/Longitude`: This dataset contains longitude data.
	* `longitude` is extracted as a 1D array.

**Data Processing**

The code replaces any values in the O3 data that match the fill value with NaN (Not a Number) using NumPy's broadcasting capabilities.

**Creating Map Visualization**

The code creates a map visualization using Basemap:

1. A cylindrical projection (`projection='cyl'`) is used, with a low resolution (`resolution='l'`).
2. The map boundaries are set to cover the entire globe (`llcrnrlat=-90`, `urcrnrlat=90`, `llcrnrlon=-180`, and `urcrnrlon=180`).
3. Coastlines, parallels, and meridians are drawn using Basemap's methods.
4. The O3 data is plotted as a scatter plot on the map, with colors representing the values (using `c=data` and `cmap=plt.cm.jet`). The marker size is set to 1 (`s=1`).

**Adding Colorbar and Title**

The code adds a colorbar to the map using Basemap's `colorbar` method and sets its label to the units of the O3 data.

A title is added to the plot, which includes the file name and the long name of the O3 dataset.

**Saving Plot to File**

Finally, the code saves the plot to a PNG file with a name based on the input file name (`basename`) and appends `.py.png` to it. The `gcf()` function is used to get the current figure object, which is then saved using `savefig()`.
