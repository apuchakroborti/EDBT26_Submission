Here's a step-by-step explanation of the Python code:

**Importing Libraries**

The code starts by importing various libraries:

* `os`: for operating system-related functions
* `re`: for regular expression operations
* `h5py`: for working with HDF5 files
* `pyproj`: for projecting coordinates between different systems
* `numpy` (as `np`): for numerical computations
* `matplotlib` (as `mpl`) and `matplotlib.pyplot` (as `plt`): for plotting
* `Basemap`: a toolkit for creating maps

**Defining Constants**

The code defines several constants:

* `FILE_NAME`: the name of the HDF5 file to read from
* `GRID_NAME`: the name of the grid dataset within the HDF5 file
* `DATAFIELD_NAME`: the name of the data field dataset within the HDF5 file

**Reading HDF5 File**

The code opens the HDF5 file using `h5py` and reads the following datasets:

* The `Data Fields/SurfReflect_I3_1` dataset, which contains the actual data values
* The `StructMetadata.0` dataset, which contains metadata about the grid

**Extracting Attributes and Metadata**

The code extracts various attributes and metadata from the HDF5 file:

* Scale factor, offset, units, fill value, and long name of the data field
* Extents of the grid (upper left and lower right coordinates) using regular expressions to parse the `StructMetadata.0` dataset

**Constructing Grid**

The code constructs a 2D grid with the extracted extents:

* Creates arrays for x and y coordinates using `numpy`
* Uses `pyproj` to project the coordinates from sinusoidal to WGS84 (latitude/longitude) system
* Creates a meshgrid of x and y coordinates

**Applying Fill Value and Scale Factor**

The code applies the fill value and scale factor to the data:

* Replaces fill values with NaN (Not a Number)
* Scales the data using the extracted scale factor and offset

**Creating Plot**

The code creates a plot using `Basemap` and `matplotlib`:

* Creates a cylindrical projection map with coastlines, parallels, and meridians
* Plots the data as a pseudocolor meshgrid
* Adds a colorbar with units label
* Sets the title of the plot to include the file name and long name of the data field

**Saving Plot**

The code saves the plot to a PNG file using `matplotlib`:

* Creates a file name based on the input HDF5 file name
* Saves the figure to the file using `savefig`

Overall, this code is designed to read an HDF5 file containing a grid dataset and visualize the data using a pseudocolor meshgrid plot.
