Here's a step-by-step explanation of the provided Python code:

**Importing Libraries**

The code starts by importing various libraries:
1. `os`: for operating system-related functions.
2. `h5py`: for working with HDF5 files.
3. `numpy` (as `np`): for numerical computations.
4. `matplotlib` (as `mpl`) and `matplotlib.pyplot` (as `plt`): for data visualization.
5. `Basemap` from `mpl_toolkits.basemap`: for creating maps.

**Defining Constants**

The code defines a constant `FILE_NAME` with the path to an HDF5 file: `'ICESat_2/ATL11_051911_0321_006_06.h5'`.

**Opening and Reading HDF5 File**

The code opens the HDF5 file in read mode (`mode='r'`) using `h5py.File`. The `with` statement ensures that the file is properly closed when it's no longer needed.

Within the `with` block, the code reads various datasets from the HDF5 file:
1. `/pt1/latitude`: stores latitude values in `latvar`.
2. `/pt1/longitude`: stores longitude values in `lonvar`.
3. `/pt1/h_corr`: stores data values in `datavar`.

The code also retrieves attributes from the `datavar` dataset:
* `units`: the units of the data.
* `long_name`: a descriptive name for the data.
* `_FillValue`: a special value indicating missing or invalid data.

**Handling Fill Values**

The code replaces fill values with NaN (Not a Number) and creates a masked array using `np.ma.masked_where`. This allows for proper handling of missing data in subsequent operations.

**Creating a Map**

The code uses `Basemap` to create an equidistant cylindrical projection map:
* Sets the projection type, resolution, and boundaries.
* Draws coastlines, parallels, and meridians on the map.

**Plotting Data**

The code plots the data on the map using `m.scatter`:
* Uses longitude and latitude values as coordinates.
* Colors the points based on the data values (`c=data[:,0]`) using a jet colormap.
* Sets point sizes to 1 pixel.

**Adding Colorbar and Title**

The code adds a colorbar to the plot with a label set to the units of the data. It also sets a title for the plot, including the file name, dataset name, and long name of the data.

**Saving the Plot**

Finally, the code saves the plot as a PNG image using `fig.savefig`. The file name is constructed by appending `.py.png` to the base name of the HDF5 file.
