Here's a step-by-step explanation of the Python code:

**Importing Libraries**

The code starts by importing various libraries:
1. `os`: for operating system-related functions
2. `matplotlib` and `matplotlib.pyplot` (as `mpl` and `plt`): for creating plots and visualizations
3. `Basemap`: for creating maps and projections
4. `numpy` (as `np`): for numerical computations and array operations
5. `h5py`: for working with HDF5 files

**Defining Constants**

The code defines two constants:
1. `FILE_NAME`: the name of the HDF5 file to be read, which is `DeepBlue-SeaWiFS-1.0_L3_20100101_v004-20130604T131317Z.h5`
2. `DATAFIELD_NAME`: the name of the dataset within the HDF5 file that contains the data of interest, which is `aerosol_optical_thickness_550_ocean`

**Reading HDF5 File**

The code uses the `h5py` library to open the HDF5 file in read-only mode (`mode='r'`) and assigns it to a variable `f`. The `with` statement ensures that the file is properly closed when we're done with it.

Within the `with` block, the code reads the following datasets from the HDF5 file:
1. `data`: the values of the `aerosol_optical_thickness_550_ocean` dataset
2. `latitude`: the latitude values associated with the data
3. `longitude`: the longitude values associated with the data

**Extracting Attributes**

The code extracts two attributes from the `DATAFIELD_NAME` dataset:
1. `long_name`: a string attribute that contains a human-readable description of the dataset
2. `_FillValue`: a special value used to represent missing or invalid data in the dataset

**Data Processing**

The code performs the following operations on the data:
1. Replaces values equal to `_FillValue` with `NaN` (Not a Number) using NumPy's `nan` function.
2. Creates a masked array using NumPy's `masked_array` function, where `NaN` values are considered invalid.

**Map Visualization**

The code uses the `Basemap` library to create an equidistant cylindrical projection of the data:
1. Creates a `Basemap` object with a low-resolution coastline database and sets the projection parameters.
2. Draws the coastline using `drawcoastlines`.
3. Draws parallels and meridians using `drawparallels` and `drawmeridians`, respectively.
4. Uses `pcolormesh` to create a pseudocolor plot of the data, with latitude and longitude as the x and y axes, respectively.

**Plot Customization**

The code customizes the plot:
1. Sets the title of the plot using the file name and long name attributes.
2. Creates a colorbar using `colorbar`.

**Saving the Plot**

Finally, the code saves the plot to a PNG file with a filename based on the HDF5 file name, using `matplotlib`'s `savefig` function.

The program's perspective is to read an HDF5 file containing scientific data, extract specific datasets and attributes, process the data, and visualize it as a map using Basemap. The code provides detailed comments and explanations throughout, making it easy to follow along.
