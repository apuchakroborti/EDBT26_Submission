Here's a step-by-step explanation of the provided Python code:

**Importing Libraries**

The code starts by importing various libraries needed for the script to run:

1. `os`: The operating system library, used for file operations.
2. `h5py`: A library for working with HDF5 files in Python.
3. `matplotlib` and `matplotlib.pyplot`: Libraries for creating plots and visualizations.
4. `Basemap`: A toolkit for creating maps and visualizing geospatial data.
5. `numpy`: A library for numerical computations.

**Defining Constants**

The script defines a constant `FILE_NAME` with the value `'MLS-Aura_L2GP-H2O_v04-20-c01_2013d003.he5'`, which is the name of the HDF5 file to be accessed and visualized.

**Accessing the HDF5 File**

The script uses the `h5py` library to open the HDF5 file in read-only mode (`mode='r'`) using a `with` statement. This ensures that the file is properly closed when the script finishes executing, regardless of whether an exception occurs or not.

**Extracting Data from the HDF5 File**

Within the `with` block, the script extracts various datasets and attributes from the HDF5 file:

1. `name`: The dataset `/HDFEOS/SWATHS/H2O/Data Fields/L2gpValue` is extracted.
2. `pname`: The dataset `/HDFEOS/SWATHS/H2O/Geolocation Fields/Pressure` is extracted.
3. `subset`: A subset of the data is selected, starting from index 0.
4. `data`: The values in the `name` dataset are extracted for the selected subset.
5. `pres`: The values in the `pname` dataset are extracted.
6. `punits`: The units attribute of the `pname` dataset is decoded and stored.
7. `units`: The units attribute of the `name` dataset is decoded and stored.
8. `longname`: The title attribute of the `name` dataset is decoded and stored.

**Extracting Geolocation Data**

The script extracts geolocation data from the HDF5 file:

1. `latitude`: The values in the `/HDFEOS/SWATHS/H2O/Geolocation Fields/Latitude` dataset are extracted.
2. `longitude`: The values in the `/HDFEOS/SWATHS/H2O/Geolocation Fields/Longitude` dataset are extracted.

**Creating a Map**

The script uses the `Basemap` library to create a map:

1. A cylindrical projection (`projection='cyl'`) is used with a low resolution (`resolution='l'`).
2. The map boundaries are set to (-90, 90) for latitude and (-180, 180) for longitude.
3. Coastlines are drawn with a line width of 0.5.
4. Parallels (latitude lines) and meridians (longitude lines) are drawn with labels.

**Plotting Data**

The script plots the extracted data on the map:

1. The `scatter` function is used to plot the data points, colored by their values (`c=data`) using a jet colormap.
2. A colorbar is created at the bottom of the plot, labeled with the units of the data.

**Creating a Plot Title**

The script creates a title for the plot:

1. The base name of the HDF5 file is used as the first line of the title.
2. The second line of the title includes the long name of the dataset, the pressure value, and its units.

**Saving the Plot**

Finally, the script saves the plot to a PNG file with a name based on the HDF5 file name:

1. The `gcf` function is used to get the current figure.
2. The `savefig` method is called to save the plot to a file named `<basename>.py.png`.
