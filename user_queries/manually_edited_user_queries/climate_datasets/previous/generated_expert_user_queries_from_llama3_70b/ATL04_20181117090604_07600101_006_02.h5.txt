Here's a step-by-step explanation of the provided Python code:

**Importing Libraries**

The code starts by importing several libraries:

1. `os`: for operating system-related functions
2. `matplotlib.pyplot` as `plt`: for creating plots and visualizations
3. `numpy` as `np`: for numerical computations
4. `mpl_toolkits.basemap` as `Basemap`: for creating maps and geographic projections
5. `h5py`: for reading and manipulating HDF5 files

**Defining the HDF5 File**

The code defines a variable `FILE_NAME` with the name of an HDF5 file: `"ATL04_20181117090604_07600101_006_02.h5"`.

**Opening the HDF5 File**

The code opens the HDF5 file in read-only mode (`mode="r"`) using the `h5py` library. The file is opened as a context manager, which ensures that the file is properly closed when it goes out of scope.

**Accessing Datasets in the HDF5 File**

The code accesses several datasets within the HDF5 file:

1. `/profile_1/latitude`: retrieves an array of latitude values and its valid range (minimum and maximum values) from the `latvar` dataset.
2. `/profile_1/longitude`: retrieves an array of longitude values and its valid range from the `lonvar` dataset.
3. `/profile_1/dem_h`: retrieves an array of height values, its units, and its long name from the `tempvar` dataset.

**Creating a Map**

The code creates a map using the `Basemap` library:

1. It defines a cylindrical projection with a low-resolution coastline database.
2. It sets the latitude and longitude ranges for the map.
3. It draws coastlines, parallels, and meridians on the map.

**Plotting Data**

The code plots the height data (`temp`) on the map using the `scatter` function:

1. It uses the longitude and latitude values as the x and y coordinates.
2. It colors the points based on their height values using a jet colormap.
3. It sets the point size to 1 and removes edge colors.

**Adding Colorbar and Title**

The code adds a colorbar to the plot with a label indicating the units of the height data. It also sets a title for the plot, which includes the file name and the long name of the height dataset.

**Saving the Plot**

Finally, the code saves the plot as a PNG image using the `savefig` function from `matplotlib`. The file name is constructed by appending `.py.png` to the base name of the HDF5 file.
