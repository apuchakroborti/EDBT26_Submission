Python code. 
It starts by importing necessary libraries and defining constants. 
The main constant is `FILE_NAME`, which is set to "ATL13_20190330212241_00250301_006_01.h5".

The code then reads the HDF5 file using `h5py`. Within the file, it accesses three datasets: 
`/gt1l/segment_lat` for latitude values, `/gt1l/segment_lon` for longitude values, and `/gt1l/segment_geoid` for geoid data. 

Each dataset is read into memory using slicing.

The code handles missing or invalid values by replacing them with `NaN` and masking them. 
It then creates an equidistant cylindrical projection map using `Basemap`, drawing coastlines, parallels, and meridians. 
The data points are scattered on the map, colored according to their geoid values.

A colorbar is created with a label indicating the units of the geoid data, and the plot title is set based on the file name, dataset name, and long name of the geoid data. 
Finally, the plot is saved as a PNG file, with the file name constructed from the HDF5 file's base name.
