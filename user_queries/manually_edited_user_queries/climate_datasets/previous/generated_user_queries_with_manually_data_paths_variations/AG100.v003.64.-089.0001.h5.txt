a Python script that reads an HDF5 file containing ASTER GED data, extracts specific datasets, and visualizes them on a map. 

The main function `run` takes an input file name and performs the following steps:

1. Reads the input file using HDF5.
2. Extracts datasets: 
    - `Mean Emissivity for Band 10` (2D array with shape `(1, :, :)`)
    - `Latitude` and `Longitude` (1D arrays)
3. Applies fill value (-9999) and scaling (0.001) to the extracted data.
4. Creates an equidistant cylindrical projection map using Basemap.
5. Plots the scaled data on the map using `pcolormesh`.
6. Adds a colorbar and title to the plot.

The script then sets the input file name to `AG100.v003.64.-089.0001.h5` 
and checks for an environment variable `HDFEOS_ZOO_DIR` to locate the input file. 
Finally, it calls the `run` function with the input file name as an argument.
