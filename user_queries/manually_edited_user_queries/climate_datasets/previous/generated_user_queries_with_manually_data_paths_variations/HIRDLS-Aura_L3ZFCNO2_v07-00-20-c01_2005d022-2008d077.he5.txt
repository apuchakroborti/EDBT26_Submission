A Python script. It reads an HDF-EOS5 file, extracts specific datasets, manipulates the data, and creates a contour plot.

The script starts by opening the HDF-EOS5 file and reading various datasets: 
    `NO2Ascending` (a 3D dataset containing NO2 data), 
    `Latitude` (a 1D dataset containing latitude values), 
    `Pressure` (a 1D dataset containing pressure values), 
    `Time` (a scalar dataset containing the time of measurement), 
    and `nCoeffs` (a scalar dataset containing the number of coefficients).
    The above all datasets from the root directory HDFEOS INFORMATION

The script then reads attributes associated with each dataset, such as units, titles, and fill values. 
It performs some data manipulation, including converting the date stored in `Time`, replacing fill values with NaN values, and creating a masked array for the `NO2Ascending` dataset.

Finally, the script creates a contour plot of the `NO2Ascending` dataset using latitude on the x-axis and pressure on the y-axis, adds a colorbar, labels the axes, and saves the plot as a PNG file.
