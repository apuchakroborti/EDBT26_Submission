Here's a step-by-step explanation of the provided code:

The code starts by importing necessary libraries and defining an HDF5 file named "ATL04_20181117090604_07600101_006_02.h5". 
It then opens the file in read-only mode.

The code accesses several datasets within the HDF5 file, including:

* Latitude: `/profile_1/latitude`
* Longitude: `/profile_1/longitude`
* Height (dem_h): `dem_h` from root group profile_1

For each dataset, it retrieves the valid range from the dataset's attributes.

The code then uses a map projection to plot the data. It creates an equidistant cylindrical projection and draws coastlines, parallels, and meridians on the map. A scatter plot is created using longitude, latitude, and height values.

Finally, the code adds a colorbar and title to the plot, including the file name and long name of the height dataset. 
The plot is then saved as a PNG image with a filename constructed from the HDF5 file's base name.
