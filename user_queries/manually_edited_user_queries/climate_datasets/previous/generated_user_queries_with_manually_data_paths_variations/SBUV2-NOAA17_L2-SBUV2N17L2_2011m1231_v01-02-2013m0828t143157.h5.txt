**Importing Libraries**

The script starts by importing necessary libraries.

**Defining Constants**

It defines a constant `FILE_NAME` for the HDF5 file to be read.

**Reading Data**

The script opens the HDF5 file and reads various datasets:
- `/SCIENCE_DATA/ProfileO3Retrieved`: 2D ozone profile data
- `/GEOLOCATION_DATA/Latitude`: 1D latitude values
- `/ANCILLARY_DATA/PressureLevels`: 1D pressure level values
- `nTimes`: 1D time values in seconds since 1993-01-01

**Data Processing**

The script processes the ozone profile data by replacing invalid values with NaN, and creating a masked array.

**Sorting Latitude Values**

It sorts latitude values in ascending order.

**Converting Time Values**

Time values are converted from seconds to datetime objects.

**Plotting the Data**

A contour plot is created using latitude on the x-axis and pressure levels on the y-axis. The colorbar is labeled with ozone profile data units.

**Customizing the Plot**

The script customizes the plot by setting axis labels, adding a title, and annotating start and end times. It also inverts the y-axis, applies a log scale, and removes scientific notation from tick labels.

**Saving the Plot**

Finally, the script saves the plot as a PNG file with a name derived from the HDF5 file name.
