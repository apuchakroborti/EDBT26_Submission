Python code that reads and visualizes data from an HDF-EOS5 file. Here's what it does:

Reading the File

The code opens the HDF-EOS5 file in read-only mode and assigns it to a variable.

Accessing Datasets

It reads three datasets: 

 `/HDFEOS/GRIDS/O3/dset_var` containing ozone (O3) data
 `/HDFEOS/GRIDS/PRES/dset_pres` containing pressure data
 `/HDFEOS/GRIDS/TIME/dset_time` containing time data

Reading Data and Attributes

The code reads the data from each dataset, along with their associated attributes like units, titles, and fill values.

Data Processing

It performs some tasks:

Replaces fill values in ozone (O3) data with NaN
Converts date stored as a six-digit number to a string using `datetime`

Plotting

The code creates a plot of ozone (O3) data against pressure, customizing it with scientific notation for x-axis tick labels, log scale for the y-axis, inverted y-axis, and customized axis labels and title.

Saving Plot

Finally, it saves the plot to a PNG file.
