First, define constants like the file name. 
Then, open the HDF5 file in read-only mode and access datasets within it: 
    `reference_photon_lat` for latitude values, `reference_photon_lon` for longitude values, and `tx_pulse_energy` for pulse energy values from the subgroup /gt1l/geolocation.

Next, create an equidistant cylindrical map projection with a low-resolution coastline database. 
Plot the pulse energy values on this map using a scatter plot, customizing it with options like color maps and marker sizes.

Add a color bar to the plot and set a title that includes the file name and a descriptive label. 
Finally, save the plot to a PNG file derived from the HDF5 file name.
