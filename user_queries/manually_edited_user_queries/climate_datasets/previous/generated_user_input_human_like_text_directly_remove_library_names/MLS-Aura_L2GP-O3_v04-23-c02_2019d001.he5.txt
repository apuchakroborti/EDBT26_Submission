Python script. Here's what it does:

The script starts by opening an HE5 file named "MLS-Aura_L2GP-O3_v04-23-c02_2019d001.he5" in read mode.

It then accesses several datasets within the file using their full paths:

* "HDFEOS/SWATHS/O3/Data Fields/L2gpValue" (Ozone data)
* "HDFEOS/SWATHS/O3/Geolocation Fields/Latitude" (latitude values)
* "HDFEOS/SWATHS/O3/Geolocation Fields/Pressure" (pressure levels)
* "HDFEOS/SWATHS/O3/Geolocation Fields/Time" (time information)

The script reads the data from each dataset, including units and titles. It also replaces fill values with NaNs and creates a masked array.

Next, it converts the time information from seconds since 1993-01-01 to a string format.

Finally, the script visualizes the Ozone data using a pseudocolor plot, adds a colorbar with units, and sets axis labels and title. The plot is then saved to a PNG file named after the input HE5 file.
