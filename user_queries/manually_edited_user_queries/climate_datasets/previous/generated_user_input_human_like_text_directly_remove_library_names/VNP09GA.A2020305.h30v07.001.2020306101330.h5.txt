a Python script that reads an HDF5 file and creates a map plot. Here's how it works:

**Importing Libraries**

The script starts by importing necessary libraries for file system operations, parsing metadata strings, working with HDF5 files, performing cartographic transformations, numerical computations, and creating visualizations.

**Defining Constants**

Three constants are defined: `FILE_NAME` (the HDF5 file name), `GRID_NAME` (the grid dataset name within the HDF5 file), and `DATAFIELD_NAME` (the data field dataset name).
GRID_NAME is 'VNP_Grid_500m_2D' DATAFIELD_NAME are 'SurfReflect_I3_1' and HDFEOS INFORMATION StructMetadata.0'

**Reading HDF5 File**

The script opens the specified HDF5 file, accesses the desired grid and data field datasets, and reads the actual data values into a NumPy array.

**Reading Attributes**

Various attributes associated with the data field dataset are read, including scaling factor, offset, units of measurement, fill value, and descriptive name.

**Constructing Grid**

Grid extent information is extracted from metadata using regular expressions. The script then creates linearly spaced arrays and meshgrid arrays from the grid extent coordinates.

**Coordinate Transformations**

A coordinate transformation from Sinusoidal to WGS84 (Latitude-Longitude) is performed using a projection library.

**Data Processing**

The script applies the fill value and scaling factor to the data values, replacing fill values with NaN and scaling the data.

**Visualization**

A zoomed-in map plot is created using a mapping toolkit. The plot includes transformed longitude and latitude coordinates, parallels and meridians, and a pseudocolor mesh plot of the data values with a colorbar.

**Saving Plot**

Finally, the script saves the plot to a PNG file constructed from the HDF5 file base name.

I want to keep all the implementation details while removing any mentions of specific Python libraries. I also want to preserve the names of parent groups for each dataset so that they can be identified within the HDF5 hierarchy.
