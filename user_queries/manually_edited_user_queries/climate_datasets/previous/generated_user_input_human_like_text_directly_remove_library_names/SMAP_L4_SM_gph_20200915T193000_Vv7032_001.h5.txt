a Python code. Here's what it does:

The code starts by importing necessary libraries and defining an HDF5 file named `'SMAP_L4_SM_gph_20200915T193000_Vv7032_001.h5'`.

It then opens the HDF5 file in read-only mode using a context manager, ensuring the file is properly closed when the script finishes executing. Within the context manager, it accesses various datasets and attributes:

* `sm_profile` dataset under `/Geophysical_Data/`
* Reads entire dataset into an array called `data`
* Reads attributes like `units`, `long_name`, `_FillValue`, `valid_max`, and `valid_min`

The code then processes the `data` array by decoding attribute values, identifying invalid values, and creating a masked array to exclude NaN values.

It also reads two additional datasets: `latitude` under `/cell_lat/` and `longitude` under `/cell_lon/`.

Using these data points, it creates a map visualization with coastlines, parallels, and meridians drawn on the map. The plot is customized with a colorbar and title using the HDF5 file name and long name associated with the `sm_profile` dataset.

Finally, the code saves the plot as a PNG image file using the HDF5 file base name.

Can you help me understand this code better?
