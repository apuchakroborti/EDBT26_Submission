a Python code. Here's what it does:

**Importing Libraries and Defining File Names**

The code starts by importing necessary libraries and defining two file names: `FILE_NAME` for an ECOSTRESS L2 HDF5 file and `FILE_NAME_GEO` for an ECOSTRESS L1B GEO HDF5 file.

**Opening HDF5 Files and Accessing Data**

It opens both files in read-only mode and accesses the following data:

* `/SDS/LST` dataset (Land Surface Temperature data) with attributes like scale, offset, units, fill value, and long name
* `/Geolocation/longitude` and `/Geolocation/latitude` datasets (longitude and latitude data)

**Data Processing**

The code processes the LST data by replacing fill values with NaN, applying a scale factor and offset, and creating a masked array. It also masks longitude and latitude data using NaN.

**Map Visualization**

Using a cylindrical projection, the code creates a map visualization with coastlines, parallels, and meridians drawn. It then scatter plots the LST data using longitude and latitude values, with a colorbar.

**Plot Customization**

Finally, it customizes the plot by setting a title using file name and long name attributes and saves the plot to a PNG file.
