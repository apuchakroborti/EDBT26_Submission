Read and visualize data from an HDF-EOS5 file located at HIRDLS-Aura_L2_v07-00-20-c01_2008d077.he5.

The code should:
1. Import necessary libraries: os, datetime, h5py, numpy as np, FormatStrFormatter and ScalarFormatter from matplotlib.ticker, matplotlib as mpl, matplotlib.pyplot as plt, and Basemap from mpl_toolkits.basemap.

2. Read three datasets:
   - O3 data from /HDFEOS/SWATHS/HIRDLS/Data Fields/O3 (extract 0th index along x-axis and all y-axis data)
   - Pressure data from /HDFEOS/SWATHS/HIRDLS/Geolocation Fields/Pressure
   - Time data from /HDFEOS/SWATHS/HIRDLS/Geolocation Fields/Time (only 0th index)

3. Read attributes:
   - Units from O3 and Pressure datasets
   - Title from O3, Time, and Pressure datasets
   - _FillValue from O3 dataset

4. Decode attribute values using decode().

5. Replace O3 data with NaN where it matches _FillValue.

6. Create datestr variable by initializing a datetime object at 1993-01-01 and adding seconds from the Time dataset.

7. Generate a plot of O3 vs Pressure:
   - Customize x-axis with scientific notation
   - Set y-axis to log scale and invert it
   - Format axis labels using dataset Titles and Units
   - Set title combining filename, O3 Title, and Units

8. Display the plot.
