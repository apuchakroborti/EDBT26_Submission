A Python script that reads an HDF5 file containing ASTER GED data, extracts specific datasets, and visualizes them on a map.

1. Import necessary libraries: os, matplotlib, matplotlib.pyplot, numpy, mpl_toolkits.basemap, h5py.

2. Read the input HDF5 file in read-only mode.

3. Extract datasets:
   - 'Mean Emissivity for Band 10' from '/Emissivity/Mean' as a 2D slice (1st index along x-axis).
   - Retrieve the Description attribute's 0th value.
   - Set units to None and long_name to 'Mean emissivity for Band 10'.

4. Extract geolocation data:
   - Latitude from '/Geolocation/Latitude'.
   - Longitude from '/Geolocation/Longitude'.

5. Process mean data:
   - Replace -9999 with NaN.
   - Scale by multiplying with 0.001.
   - Apply mask using numpy's masked_where.

6. Create an equidistant cylindrical projection map with Basemap, setting latitude (62.5-64.5) and longitude (89.5-87.5) ranges.

7. Add map features:
   - Coastlines with linewidth 0.5.
   - Parallels at 62, 63, 64 with specific labels.
   - Meridians at -89, -88, -87.5 with specific labels.

8. Plot data using pcolormesh with latlon=True.

9. Add colorbar labeled 'None' and a title combining the filename's base name with 'Mean Emissivity for Band 10'.
