Create a Python script to visualize data from a GESDISC MEaSUREs GSSTF HDF-EOS5 grid file.

Steps:
1. Import necessary libraries: os, h5py, numpy as np, matplotlib as mpl, matplotlib.pyplot as plt, and mpl_toolkits.basemap import Basemap.
2. Read the HDF file located at 'GSSTF_3_2008_12_31.he5'.
3. Extract the 'E' dataset from '/HDFEOS/GRIDS/SET1/Data Fields/E', including its attributes ('units' and 'long_name') using decode(), and retrieve the _FillValue attribute.
4. Preprocess data by replacing _FillValue with np.nan and create a masked array using np.masked_array with conditions based on np.isnan(data).
5. Construct longitude and latitude arrays based on the shape of the 'E' dataset since they are not provided in the file.
6. Create a cylindrical projection map with boundaries set for low resolution, latitudes from -90 to 90, and longitudes from -180 to 180.
7. Add parallels at [-90, 120, 30] degrees latitude with labels [1,0,0,0], and meridians at [-180, 180, 45] degrees longitude with labels [0,0,0,1].
8. Visualize the data using pcolormesh with parameters longitude, latitude, data, and latlon=True.
9. Add a colorbar and a descriptive title to the plot.
