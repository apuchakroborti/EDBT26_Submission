I am working with an HDF5 file containing SMAP Level 1C data. The script should begin by importing necessary libraries: os, datetime, h5py, numpy as np, matplotlib as mpl, matplotlib.pyplot as plt, and mpl_toolkits.basemap import Basemap.

Define a constant `filename` with the value "SMAP_L1C_TB_50719_D_20240730T124417_R19240_001.h5".

The program should read this HDF5 file in read-only mode. Access the main dataset at "/Global_Projection/cell_tb_h_fore" and geolocation datasets at "/Global_Projection/cell_lat" (latitude) and "/Global_Projection/cell_lon" (longitude).

Extract attributes from the cell_tb_h_fore dataset: units, long_name, _FillValue, valid_max, and valid_min. Decode these attributes using 'ascii' encoding with 'replace' as the error handling parameter.

Identify invalid data by combining two conditions using numpy's logical_or: values greater than valid_max or less than valid_min. Update this mask to include values equal to _FillValue. Replace invalid data in cell_tb_h_fore with NaNs and create a masked array using numpy's masked_where function, checking for NaNs.

For visualization, initialize a Basemap object with a cylindrical projection. Set map boundaries from -90 to 90 latitude and -180 to 180 longitude. Add coastlines with a line width of 0.5. Draw parallels at intervals of 45 degrees and meridians at the same interval, labeling them as [True, False, False, True].

Create a scatter plot using longitude and latitude coordinates, with data from cell_tb_h_fore, point size 1, colormap 'jet', no edge color, and linewidth 0. Add a colorbar below the plot with 10% padding and label it with the units attribute.

Set the plot title to the concatenation of the filename's basename and long_name, using fontsize 7.
