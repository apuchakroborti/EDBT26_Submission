A script to visualize precipitation rate data from an HDF5 file by following these steps:

1. Import Libraries: Use os, matplotlib, matplotlib.pyplot, numpy, mpl_toolkits.basemap, and h5py.

2. Open HDF5 File: Access the file in read-only mode and extract the `precipRateESurface` dataset along with its units and _FillValue attribute.

3. Handle Missing Data: Replace _FillValue entries with NaNs using numpy's masked_where function to mask the data where values are NaN.

4. Retrieve Geolocation Data: Extract latitude from `Latitude` and longitude from `Longitude`.

5. Set Up Map Projection: Create a cylindrical projection with low resolution, spanning latitudes from -90 to 90 and longitudes from -180 to 180.

6. Customize Map: Add coastlines (width 0.5), parallels at [-90, -45, 0, 45, 90], and meridians at [-180, -135, -90, -45, 0, 45, 90, 135, 180] with labels [True, False, False, True] with specific labels.

7. Plot Data: Use a scatter plot with the 'jet' colormap, point size of 1, based on longitude and latitude coordinates.

8. Add Colorbar and Title: Include a colorbar below the plot, labeled with the dataset's units, and set the title to reflect the file and dataset name.
