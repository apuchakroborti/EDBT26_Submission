Here is the reduced text while keeping as many implementation details as possible:

**Importing necessary libraries**

The code starts by importing various Python libraries:
```python
import os
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
from mpl_toolkits.basemap import Basemap
import h5py
```
These libraries are used for data manipulation, visualization, and HDF5 file handling.

**Setting font size**

The code sets the font size to 9 using Matplotlib's `rcParams`:
```python
mpl.rcParams.update({"font.size": 9})
```
This is done because the file name is quite long, and a smaller font size will make it easier to read.

**Opening the HDF5 file**

The code opens the HDF5 file using `h5py`:
```python
with h5py.File(FILE_NAME, mode="r") as f:
    ...
```
The `mode="r"` argument specifies that we want to read the file (as opposed to writing or appending). The `with` statement ensures that the file is properly closed when we're done with it.

**Reading a dataset and plotting data**

Within the `with` block, the code reads a specific dataset from the HDF5 file:
```python
name = "/S1/Tb"
data = f[name][:, :, 0]
...
m.scatter(longitude, latitude, c=data, s=1, cmap=plt.cm.jet)
```
Here's what's happening:

* The `scatter` method plots points on the map using the longitude, latitude, and data values.
* The `c` argument specifies the color of each point based on the corresponding value in the `data` array.

**Creating a Basemap**

The code uses the `Basemap` library to create a map projection:
```python
m = Basemap(projection="cyl", resolution="l", llcrnrlat=-90, urcrnlnlat=90, llcrnrlon=-180, urcrnrlon=180)
```
The `Basemap` object is used to create a cylindrical map projection with the specified bounds (latitudes and longitudes).

**Drawing coastlines, parallels, and meridians**

The code uses various methods of the `Basemap` object to draw coastlines, parallels, and meridians on the map:
```python
m.drawcoastlines(linewidth=0.5)
m.drawparallels(np.arange(-90, 91, 45))
m.drawmeridians(np.arange(-180, 180, 45), labels=[True, False, False, True])
```
These methods create a map with coastlines, parallels (latitude lines), and meridians (longitude lines).

**Saving the plot as an image file**

Finally, the code saves the plot as a PNG file using Matplotlib's `savefig` method:
```python
plt.title("{0}\n{1}".format(basename, name + " (nchan1=0)"))
fig = plt.gcf()
pngfile = "{0}.py.png".format(basename)
fig.savefig(pngfile)
```
Here's what's happening:

* The `basename` variable extracts the file name from the full path.
* The `plt.title` method sets the title of the plot, including the file name and dataset information.
* The `fig = plt.gcf()` line gets a reference to the current figure.
* The `pngfile` variable constructs the output file name by appending ".py.png" to the file name.
* The `fig.savefig(pngfile)` method saves the plot as a PNG file with the specified name.
