Here's the reduced text while keeping as many implementation details as possible:

**Importing necessary libraries**

The script imports four libraries:
1. `os`
2. `matplotlib.pyplot` (as `plt`)
3. `numpy` (as `np`)
4. `mpl_toolkits.basemap`

**Defining the HDF5 file name and opening it**

The script defines the HDF5 file name: `"ATL22_20210712003905_02811201_003_01.h5"`. It then opens the file using `h5py` in read-only mode (`"r"`).
```python
with h5py.File(FILE_NAME, mode="r") as f:
    # ...
```
**Accessing datasets and handling FillValue**

The script accesses three datasets: `latvar`, `lonvar`, and `datavar`. It checks for `_FillValue` in the dataset and sets it to NaN using NumPy's `astype`.
```python
dataf = data.astype(float)
dataf[data == _FillValue] = np.nan
```
**Creating a map, plotting data, and adding a colorbar**

The script creates an equidistant cylindrical projection of the Earth with a low resolution coastline database. It draws coastlines, parallels, and meridians on the map.
```python
m = Basemap(
    projection="cyl",
    resolution="l",
    llcrnrlat=-90,
    urcrnrlat=90,
    llcrnrlon=-180,
    urcrnrlon=180,
)
```
The script plots the values from `data` as colored points on the map using `m.scatter`. It adds a colorbar and sets its label to the units of the dataset.

**Saving the plot**

The script saves the plot as a PNG file.
```python
pngfile = "{0}.py.png".format(basename)
fig.savefig(pngfile)
```
This is the final output: a visual representation of the data from the HDF5 file, with a colorbar and title.
