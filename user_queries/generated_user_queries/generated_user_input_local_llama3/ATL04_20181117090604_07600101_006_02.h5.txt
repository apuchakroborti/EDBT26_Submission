Here's the reduced text while keeping implementation details:

**Importing necessary modules**

The code imports:
* `os` for interacting with the operating system
* `matplotlib.pyplot as plt` for creating visualizations
* `numpy as np` for efficient numerical computation
* `mpl_toolkits.basemap` for creating maps

**Defining the file name and opening the HDF5 file**

The code defines a constant `FILE_NAME` with the value `"ATL04_20181117090604_07600101_006_02.h5"` and opens the HDF5 file using `h5py.File()` in read-only mode.

**Accessing and processing data from the file**

1. **Ground Track L1**: The code accesses `/profile_1/latitude` and `/profile_1/longitude` datasets, extracts values, and stores them in `latitude` and `longitude` variables.
2. **Height data**: The code accesses `dem_h` dataset from `/profile_1/`, extracts values, and stores them in `temp` variable. It also retrieves metadata attributes.

**Plotting and creating a map**

The code plots height data as a scatter plot with longitude on the x-axis, latitude on the y-axis, and color determined by height value. Then, it creates an equidistant cylindrical projection map using `Basemap`, drawing coastlines, parallels, and meridians.

**Saving the plot**

The code saves the plot as a PNG file using `matplotlib.pyplot.savefig()` function, constructing the file name from the HDF5 file's base name.

Note: This code assumes the HDF5 file is in the current working directory.
