Here is the reduced text, keeping as many implementation details as possible:

**Importing necessary libraries**

The code imports various Python libraries, including `os`, `matplotlib`, `Basemap`, and `h5py`.

**Defining constants and variables**

The code defines several constants and variables, such as `FILE_NAME`, `path`, and `DATAFIELD_NAME`.

**Opening the HDF5 file**

The code opens the HDF5 file using `h5py` in read-only mode.

**Reading the dataset**

The code reads a specific dataset from the HDF5 file, converts it to a NumPy array, and sets missing values to NaN.

**Retrieving attributes**

The code retrieves various attributes associated with the dataset, such as scale, offset, and units.

**Processing the data**

The code scales and offsets the data according to the `ScaleFactor` and `Offset` attributes.

**Creating a map**

The code creates an equidistant cylindrical projection using Basemap, draws coastlines, parallels, and meridians, and creates a scatter plot of data points on the map.

**Creating a color bar**

The code creates a color bar for the scatter plot with a label set to the units attribute value.

**Saving the plot**

The code saves the plot as an image file with a title that includes the base name of the HDF5 file and the title attribute value.
