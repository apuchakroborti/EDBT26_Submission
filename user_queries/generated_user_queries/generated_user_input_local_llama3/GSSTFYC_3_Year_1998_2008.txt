Here is a reduced version of the text, keeping as many implementation details as possible:

This Python script reads a GESDISC MEaSUREs GSSTF HDF-EOS5 grid file and visualizes its data using matplotlib.

**Step 1: Import necessary libraries**

The script imports:
* `datetime` for dates
* `os` for operating system interactions
* `matplotlib` (as `mpl`) for plotting, specifically `matplotlib.pyplot` (as `plt`)
* `numpy` (as `np`) for numerical computations
* `Basemap` from `mpl_toolkits.basemap` for creating maps

**Step 2: Define a function `run(FILE_NAME)`**

The `run` function takes the HDF5 file name as input.

**Step 3: Read the HDF5 file using either `netCDF4` or `h5py`**

The script reads the HDF5 file:
* If `USE_NETCDF4` is `True`, it uses `netCDF4` to read the file.
	+ Opens the file using `Dataset(FILE_NAME)`
	+ Navigates down the hierarchy to retrieve the `SST` dataset
	+ Reads data values from the `SST` dataset using slicing (`data_var[:]`)
* If `USE_NETCDF4` is `False`, it uses `h5py` to read the file.
	+ Opens the file using `with h5py.File(FILE_NAME, mode='r') as f:`
	+ Navigates down the hierarchy to retrieve the `/HDFEOS/GRIDS/NCEP/Data Fields/SST` dataset
	+ Retrieves data values from the `SST` dataset using slicing (`dset_var[:]`)
	+ Reads string attributes from the `SST` dataset and decodes them to UTF-8 strings

**Step 4: Process the data**

The script processes the data:
* Applies a fill value to missing values
* Masks out missing values using NumPy's `masked_array` function
* Creates latitude and longitude arrays from the dataset shape
* Draws an equidistant cylindrical projection map using `Basemap`
* Renders the image on the plot

**Step 5: Save the plot**

The script saves the plot to a PNG file named after the input HDF5 file, with a `.py.png` extension.

I removed some of the redundant information and condensed the steps into fewer sections. Let me know if you'd like me to make any further changes!
