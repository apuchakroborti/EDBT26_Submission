Here's the reduced text while keeping as many implementation details as possible:

**Importing modules**

The code starts by importing several Python modules:
* `os`
* `matplotlib.pyplot` (imported as `plt`)
* `numpy` (imported as `np`)
* `mpl_toolkits.basemap`

**Defining constants and opening HDF5 file**

A constant `FILE_NAME` is defined with the name of the HDF5 file. The file is opened using `h5py` in read-only mode (`mode="r"`).

**Accessing data from HDF5 file**

The code accesses a dataset within the HDF5 file:
```python
name = "/Brightness_Temperature/tb_h_surface_corrected"
data = f[name][:]
```
This sets `name` to the path of the dataset and then uses that name to access the dataset using `f[name][:]`.

**Processing data**

The code processes the data by:
* Converting the data to a numpy array
* Replacing invalid values with NaN (Not a Number)
* Masking the data using `np.ma.masked_where`

**Getting geolocation data and creating map**

The code accesses two more datasets within the HDF5 file for latitude and longitude. A cylindrical map is created using the `Basemap` module.

**Plotting data on the map and creating color bar**

The code plots the data on the map using the `scatter` method and creates a color bar at the bottom.

**Setting title and saving plot**

The code sets the title of the plot to include the name of the HDF5 file and the long name of the dataset, and then saves the plot as a PNG file.

Note that I removed some of the implementation details, such as extracting metadata from the HDF5 file, to reduce the text while keeping the main steps and concepts intact.
