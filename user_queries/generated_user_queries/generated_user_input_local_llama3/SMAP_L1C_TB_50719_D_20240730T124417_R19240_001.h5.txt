Here is the reduced text, keeping as many implementation details as possible:

**Importing necessary libraries**

The code imports the following libraries:
- `os`: for operating system dependent functionality
- `matplotlib.pyplot as plt`: for creating plots
- `numpy as np`: for large arrays and matrices

**Defining constants and opening HDF5 file**

The code defines the name of the HDF5 file (`FILE_NAME`) and opens it in read mode (`"r"`):
```python
with h5py.File(FILE_NAME, mode="r") as f:
    # Code inside this block is executed when the file is open,
    # and it's automatically closed when we exit the block.
```

**Accessing data from HDF5 file**

Inside the `with` block, the code accesses some data from the HDF5 file, including:
- `name`: the path to the dataset (`"/Global_Projection/cell_tb_h_fore"``)
- `data`: the actual data
- Various attributes (units, long_name, _FillValue, valid_max, and valid_min)

The code then:
1. Gets the data and stores it in the `data` variable
2. Decodes units, long name, and fill value from ASCII to Python strings
3. Creates a mask for invalid values and replaces them with NaN
4. Uses `np.ma.masked_where` to create a masked array

**Getting geolocation data**

The code also accesses some geolocation data:
- `latitude`: the latitude data
- `longitude`: the longitude data

**Creating a map and plotting data**

The code creates a Basemap object with:
- Projection type: cylindrical (`"cyl"``)
- Resolution: low (`"l"``)
- Latitudes and longitudes for the bottom-left and top-right corners of the map

The code then:
1. Draws coastlines
2. Draws parallels at -90, 0, and 90 degrees north
3. Draws meridians at -180, 0, and 180 degrees east

**Plotting data on the map**

The code plots the data on the map using `m.scatter` with:
- Longitude values as x-coordinates
- Latitude values as y-coordinates
- Data values as colors
- Color bar with label set to units

**Saving the plot**

Finally, the code saves the plot as an image file:
1. Gets the base name of the HDF5 file using `os.path.basename`
2. Creates a title for the plot including the base name and long name
3. Saves the plot as an image file
