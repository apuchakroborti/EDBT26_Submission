**Access and Visualize ECOSTRESS L2 HDF5 File in Python**

This Python code is used to access and visualize an LP DAAC ECOSTRESS L2 HDF5 file.

1. **Import necessary modules**:
   - `os`, `matplotlib.pyplot as plt`, `numpy as np`, and `mpl_toolkits.basemap` are imported for operating system dependent functionality, visualization, numerical computation, and map creation respectively.

2. **Define file names**:
   - `FILE_NAME` and `FILE_NAME_GEO` are defined as the names of the ECOSTRESS L2 HDF5 file and the ECOSTRESS L1B GEO HDF5 file respectively.

3. **Open HDF5 files in read mode**:
   - The code opens both HDF5 files using the `h5py.File()` function.

4. **Access data from the HDF5 file**:
   - It accesses the LST (Land Surface Temperature) data and stores it in the `data` variable.
   - It also reads attributes of the LST dataset, such as scale factor, add offset, units, fill value, and long name.

5. **Apply fill value and scale factor to the data**:
   - It replaces the fill value with NaN (Not a Number) to indicate missing values.
   - It applies the scale factor and add offset to the data.

6. **Create a Basemap**:
   - The code creates a map using the `Basemap` class from `mpl_toolkits.basemap`. This map is projected in cylindrical coordinates with a resolution of "l" (low).

7. **Draw coastlines and grid lines on the map**:
   - It draws coastlines using `m.drawcoastlines()` and grid lines using `m.drawparallels()` and `m.drawmeridians()`.

8. **Plot data points on the map**:
   - It plots LST data points on the map using `m.scatter()`, with the color of each point corresponding to its LST value.

9. **Create a colorbar for the plot**:
    - The code creates a colorbar for the plot using `cb = m.colorbar()` and sets its label to the units of the LST data.

10. **Set title and save the figure**:
   - It sets the title of the plot to include the name of the HDF5 file and the long name of the LST dataset.
   - The code saves the figure as a PNG image using `fig.savefig(pngfile)`.

This is the step-by-step explanation of the Python code.
