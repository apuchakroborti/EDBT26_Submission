Here is the reduced text, keeping as many implementation details as possible:

This Python script accesses and visualizes an NSIDC ICESat-2 ATL13 L2 HDF5 file.

**Importing libraries**: The script imports:
   - `os`
   - `matplotlib.pyplot` (as `plt`)
   - `numpy` (as `np`)
   - `mpl_toolkits.basemap` (as `Basemap`)

**Opening the HDF5 file**: The script opens the specified HDF5 file in read mode (`"r"`):
```python
with h5py.File('ATL13_20190330212241_00250301_006_01.h5', 'r') as f:
    ...
```
**Accessing and processing data**: Within the `with` block, the script accesses three datasets:
   - `/gt1l/segment_lat`: Latitude values
   - `/gt1l/segment_lon`: Longitude values
   - `/gt1l/segment_geoid`: Geoid data

The script extracts data using `[:]"` and assigns it to variables: `latitude`, `longitude`, and `data`.

**Handling FillValue**: The script replaces `_FillValue` with `np.nan` (Not a Number) for missing or invalid data.

**Creating a map using Basemap**: The script creates an equidistant cylindrical projection map:
   - Sets up the map with resolution "l" (low)
   - Draws coastlines, parallels, and meridians

**Plotting data on the map**: The script plots geoid data as colored points:
   - Passes in longitude, latitude, and data values
   - Creates a color bar using `colorbar`

**Adding labels and title**: The script sets the title based on the HDF5 file name, dataset name, and long name.

**Saving the plot as an image**: The script saves the plot as a PNG image:
   - Specifies the file name by combining the base name of the HDF5 file with ".py.png".

This script provides a basic example of how to access and visualize an NSIDC ICESat-2 ATL13 L2 HDF5 file in Python.
