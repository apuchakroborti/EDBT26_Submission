Here is the reduced text while keeping as many implementation details as possible:

**Importing necessary libraries**

The code starts by importing various libraries:

1. `os`
2. `matplotlib` (aliased as `mpl`)
3. `h5py`

**Defining constants and variables**

Next, it defines some constants and variables:

1. `FILE_NAME`: the name of the HDF5 file to read
2. `DATAFIELD_NAME`: the name of the data field within the HDF5 file that contains aerosol optical thickness at 550 nm over ocean
3. `data`, `latitude`, and `longitude`: variables that will hold the values from the HDF5 file

**Reading the HDF5 file**

The code then opens the HDF5 file using `h5py`:

1. `with h5py.File(FILE_NAME, mode='r') as f:`: opens the HDF5 file in read-only mode and assigns it to a variable `f`

**Processing data**

Next, it processes the data:

1. `data[data == -999] = np.nan`: replaces values of `-999` with NaN
2. `data = np.ma.masked_array(data, np.isnan(data))`: creates a masked array where NaN values are masked out

**Creating a map and plotting data**

The code then creates a map using the `Basemap` toolkit:

1. `m = Basemap(projection='ortho', resolution='l', lat_0=lat_m, lon_0 = lon_m)`: creates a Basemap object with an orthographic projection and low-resolution coastline data centered at the mean latitude and longitude
2. `m.pcolormesh(longitude, latitude, data, latlon=True)`: creates a pseudocolor mesh plot of the data

**Adding a color bar and title**

The code then adds a color bar and title to the plot:

1. `cb = m.colorbar()`: creates a color bar
2. `plt.title('{0}\n{1}'.format(basename, long_name))`: sets the title of the plot, including the file name and long name

**Saving the plot**

Finally, it saves the plot as a PNG file:

1. `fig = plt.gcf()`: gets the current figure
2. `fig.savefig(pngfile)`: saves the plot to the specified file
