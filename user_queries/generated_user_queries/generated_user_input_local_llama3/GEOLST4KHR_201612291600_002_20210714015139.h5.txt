Here is the reduced text while keeping as many implementation details as possible:

**Importing necessary modules**

The code starts by importing several Python modules:
* `os`
* `h5py` for working with HDF5 files
* `numpy` (`np`) for numerical computations
* `matplotlib` (`mpl`) and `matplotlib.pyplot` (`plt`) for creating plots
* `Basemap` for mapping and geographic projections

**Setting the file name and opening the HDF5 file**

The code sets a constant `FILE_NAME` to `'GEOLST4KHR_201612291600_002_20210714015139.h5'`. This is the name of the HDF5 file that will be accessed. The file is opened using `h5py.File(FILE_NAME, mode='r')`, which means it opens the file in read-only mode.

**Accessing datasets and attributes**

The code accesses several datasets within the HDF5 file:
* `/lst`: a dataset containing data
* `/lon` and `/lat`: datasets containing longitude and latitude values, respectively

It reads several attributes from the `/lst` dataset:
* `scale_factor`
* `add_offset`
* `units`
* `_FillValue`
* `long_name`

**Converting datasets to NumPy arrays**

The code converts the datasets to NumPy arrays:
* `data`: the data array
* `lon` and `lat`: longitude and latitude arrays, respectively

These conversions are done using the `.astype(np.float64)` method.

**Applying fill value and scale factor, creating a mask for missing data, and plotting**

The code applies the fill value and scale factor to the `data` array. It creates a mask for missing data by creating a masked array from the `data`, `lon`, and `lat` arrays. The code uses the `Basemap` module to create a map plot.

**Saving the plot**

The code saves the plot as a PNG file:
* It gets the current figure object using `fig = plt.gcf()`
* It sets the title of the plot using `plt.title`
* It saves the plot to a file named after the HDF5 file, with a `.py.png` extension
