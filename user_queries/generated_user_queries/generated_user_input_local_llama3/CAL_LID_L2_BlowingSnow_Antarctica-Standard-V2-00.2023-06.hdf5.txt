Here is the reduced text while keeping as many implementation details as possible:

**Importing necessary libraries**

The code starts by importing four Python libraries: `h5py`, `os`, `cartopy.crs` and `matplotlib.pyplot`, and `numpy`.

**Defining constants and variables**

The code defines several constants and variables, including the name of the HDF5 file (`FILE_NAME`) and the fill value for missing data (`_FillValue`).

**Opening the HDF5 file**

The code opens the HDF5 file using the `h5py` library.

**Reading data from the HDF5 file**

The code reads data from the HDF5 file, converting it to a NumPy array of type `np.float64`. It then extracts the first column (i.e., the first dimension) of the dataset.

**Handling fill value**

The code handles the fill value by replacing it with NaN in the data array and creating a masked array.

**Plotting the data**

The code plots the data using `matplotlib`, creating a scatter plot with longitude, latitude, and color representing the data. It also adds a color bar to the plot.

**Adding additional features**

The code adds several additional features to the plot, including grid lines, coastlines, and a title.

**Saving the plot**

The code saves the plot as a PNG file.

Note that I removed some of the explanatory text and focused on the implementation details. Let me know if you'd like me to make any further changes!
