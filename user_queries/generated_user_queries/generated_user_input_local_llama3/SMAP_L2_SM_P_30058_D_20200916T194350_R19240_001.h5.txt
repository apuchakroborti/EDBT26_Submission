Here's the reduced text while keeping as many implementation details as possible:

**Importing necessary libraries**

The code starts by importing several Python libraries:

1. `os`
2. `h5py` for working with HDF5 files
3. `matplotlib` and its sub-module `mpl_toolkits.basemap` for creating visualizations (maps) and plotting data
4. `numpy` (`np`) for numerical computations and array operations

**Defining the file name**

The code defines a constant `FILE_NAME` with the path and name of an HDF5 file.

**Opening the HDF5 file**

The code opens the HDF5 file using the `h5py.File()` function, specifying the file name and mode (`'r'` for read-only).

**Accessing data from the HDF5 file**

The code accesses several datasets from the HDF5 file:

1. `name`: a string specifying the path to the dataset
2. `data`: the actual data values stored in the dataset
3. Attributes associated with the dataset

**Processing the data**

The code performs some processing on the data, including checking for invalid values and creating a masked array.

**Getting geolocation data**

The code accesses two datasets related to geolocation:

1. `latitude`
2. `longitude`

**Creating a map**

The code uses the `Basemap` class from `mpl_toolkits.basemap` to create a map, including setting the latitude and longitude limits and drawing coastlines.

**Saving the plot**

The code saves the plot as an image file, including setting the title and saving the plot to a PNG file.

**Implementation details**

Throughout the code, you'll notice that:

* The HDF5 file path is stored in the `FILE_NAME` constant.
* The dataset paths are specified using the `/Soil_Moisture_Retrieval_Data/` prefix.
* The code uses the `h5py` library to access and manipulate HDF5 files.
* The `Basemap` class from `mpl_toolkits.basemap` is used to create a map.
* The `numpy` library (`np`) is used for numerical computations and array operations.
