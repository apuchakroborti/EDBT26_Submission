Here is the reduced text while keeping as many implementation details as possible:

**Importing necessary libraries**

The code starts by importing Python modules:
```python
import os
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
from mpl_toolkits.basemap import Basemap
```
These libraries are used for file operations, plotting and visualization, numerical computations, and map projections.

**Opening the HDF5 file**

The code opens the HDF5 file in read-only mode (`mode="r"`):
```python
with h5py.File(FILE_NAME, mode="r") as f:
    ...
```
This block of code is executed when the file is opened and closed automatically when the file is no longer needed.

**Accessing a dataset within the HDF5 file**

The code accesses a specific dataset within the HDF5 file using the following lines:
```python
name = "/Grid/cloudWater"
data = f[name][0, :, :]
units = f[name].attrs["units"].decode()
_FillValue = f[name].attrs["_FillValue"]
```
Here's what each line does:

1. `name` is set to the path `/Grid/cloudWater`, which is a dataset within the HDF5 file.
2. `data` is assigned the value of the dataset at row 0, all columns (`[0, :, :]`).
3. `units` and `_FillValue` are set to the values of the "units" and "_FillValue" attributes associated with the dataset.

**Processing the data**

The code processes the data:
```python
data[data == _FillValue] = np.nan
data = np.ma.masked_where(np.isnan(data), data)
```
Here's what each line does:

1. Replace any values equal to `_FillValue` with `np.nan`.
2. Create a masked array where the mask is set to `True` for NaN values.

**Plotting the data**

The code uses Basemap to create a plot:
```python
m = Basemap(projection="cyl", resolution="l",
            llcrnrlat=-90, urcrnrlat=90,
            llcrnrlon=-180, urcrnrlon=180)
m.drawcoastlines(linewidth=0.5)
m.pcolormesh(lon, lat, data.T, latlon=True)
cb = m.colorbar()
cb.set_label(units)
```
Here's what each line does:

1. Create a Basemap object with a cylindrical projection.
2. Draw coastlines and plot the data using `pcolormesh`.
3. Create a color bar (`cb`) and set its label to the units string.

**Saving the plot**

The final lines save the plot to a PNG file:
```python
basename = os.path.basename(FILE_NAME)
plt.title("{0}\n{1}".format(basename, name))
fig = plt.gcf()
pngfile = "{0}.py.png".format(basename)
fig.savefig(pngfile)
```
Here's what each line does:

1. Get the base name of the HDF5 file using `os.path.basename`.
2. Set the title of the plot to include the base name and dataset name.
3. Save the plot to a PNG file with the same base name as the HDF5 file, but with a `.py.png` extension.

Note that some implementation details have been removed or condensed to reduce the text while keeping the core functionality intact.
