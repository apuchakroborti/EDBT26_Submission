Here is the reduced text while keeping as many implementation details as possible:

**Importing necessary libraries**

The script starts by importing several libraries:
* `os`
* `h5py`
* `datetime`
* `numpy` (as `np`)
* `matplotlib` (as `mpl`) and `matplotlib.pyplot` (as `plt`)

**Defining constants and variables**

The script defines:
* `FILE_NAME`: the name of the HDF5 file
* Variables to store datasets from the file: `dset_var`, `dset_lat`, `dset_lev`, and `dset_time`

**Opening the HDF5 file**

The script opens the HDF5 file using `h5py`:
```python
with h5py.File(FILE_NAME, mode='r') as f:
    ...
```
This code ensures that the file is closed when we're done with it.

**Accessing datasets**

The script accesses four datasets from the HDF5 file:
* `dset_var`: contains ozone zonal average data
* `dset_lat`, `dset_lev`, and `dset_time`: contain latitude, pressure level, and time data, respectively

Each dataset is accessed using the `f['/path/to/dataset']` syntax.

**Reading data**

The script reads data from each dataset:
```python
data = dset_var[:, :]
lat = dset_lat[:]
lev = dset_lev[:]
time = dset_time[:]
```
This code extracts the data and assigns it to a variable.

**Applying attribute information**

The script applies attribute information to the data:
```python
data[data < data_vmin] = np.nan
data[data > data_vmax] = np.nan
data[data == data_fillvalue] = np.nan
```
This code sets values outside the valid range or equal to the fill value to NaN.

**Creating a plot**

The script creates a contour plot using `matplotlib`:
```python
plt.contourf(lat[idx], lev, data[idx, :].T, levels=np.arange(0, 60, 5))
```
This code creates a contour plot with latitude on the x-axis and pressure level on the y-axis.

**Customizing the plot**

The script customizes the plot:
* Sets title using file name and long name
* Adds axis labels and color bar
* Inverts y-axis to put high pressure at the bottom
* Applies log scale along y-axis

**Saving the plot as an image**

The script saves the plot as a PNG image file:
```python
fig = plt.gcf()
pngfile = "{0}.py.png".format(basename)
fig.savefig(pngfile)
```
This code creates a figure object and then saves it to a PNG file with the same name as the HDF5 file.
