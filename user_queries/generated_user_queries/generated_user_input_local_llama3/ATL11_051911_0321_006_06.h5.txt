Here is the reduced text while keeping implementation details:

**Importing necessary libraries**

The code starts by importing several Python libraries:

* `os`
* `h5py` for reading and writing HDF5 files
* `numpy` (as `np`) for numerical computations
* `matplotlib` (as `mpl`) and `matplotlib.pyplot` (as `plt`) for creating plots

**Defining the HDF5 file name and opening it**

The code defines a variable `FILE_NAME` containing the path to an NSIDC ICESat-2 ATL11 L3B version 6 HDF5 file. The file is assumed to be in the current working directory.

The code then opens the HDF5 file using `h5py.File()` with mode `'r'`.

**Accessing and processing dataset variables**

Inside the `with` block, the code accesses several datasets:

1. `/pt1/latitude`
2. `/pt1/longitude`
3. `/pt1/h_corr`

The code extracts values from each dataset using `[:]` and checks for `_FillValue`. If present, it replaces those values with NaN.

**Creating a map**

The code uses `Basemap` to create an equidistant cylindrical projection map.

**Plotting data on the map**

The code plots height-corrected data as a scatter plot on the map using longitude and latitude values. The color is determined by the value in `data`.

A color bar (CB) is added with units label set to the HDF5 file's attribute.

**Saving the plot**

The code saves the plot as a PNG image file using `fig.savefig()`.

That's it!
