Here is the reduced text while keeping as many implementation details as possible:

**Importing necessary libraries**

The first four lines import Python modules:
1. `os`: for operating system-related functions
2. `h5py`: a Python library for working with HDF5 files
3. `_numpy` (as `np`): for numerical computations
4. `matplotlib` (as `mpl`) and its plotting module (`pyplot` as `plt`): for creating visualizations

**Defining constants**

The next three lines define constants:
1. `FILE_NAME`: the name of the HDF5 file to be read (`AMSR_E_L2_Land_V11_201110031920_D.he5`)
2. `DATA_NAME`: the path within the HDF5 file to access the desired data (`/HDFEOS/POINTS/AMSR-E Level 2 Land Data/Data/Combined NPD and SCA Output Fields`)
3. `FIELD_NAME`: the name of the specific field (or dataset) within the HDF5 file to be accessed (`SoilMoistureSCA`)

**Opening the HDF5 file**

The `with` statement opens the HDF5 file in read-only mode (`'r'`) using the `h5py` library.

**Accessing and processing data**

1. `datas = f[DATA_NAME][:]`: loads the dataset at the specified path into memory.
2. Extract specific fields from the dataset using their names: `latitude`, `longitude`, and `data`.
3. Replace `_FillValue_ with `np.nan` to mark missing values.

**Creating a map and plotting**

1. Create a cylindrical projection map with boundaries: `m = Basemap(projection='cyl', resolution='l', llcrnrlat=-90, urcrnrlat=90, llcrnrlon=-170, urcrnrlon=190)`.
2. Draw coastlines and parallels on the map.
3. Plot data points on the map using a scatter plot: `m.scatter(longitude, latitude, c=data, s=1, cmap=plt.cm.jet, edgecolors=None, linewidth=0)`.
4. Add a color bar to the plot.

**Adding title and saving the figure**

1. Set the title of the plot with the file name and field name.
2. Save the plot as a PNG image: `fig.savefig(pngfile)`.

The code includes many implementation details, such as:
* Using HDF5 file paths and dataset names to access specific data within the file
* Handling missing or invalid data values using masked arrays
* Creating a map and plotting data points with a color bar
* Adding a title and saving the figure to a PNG image
