Here is the reduced text, keeping as many implementation details as possible:

**Importing necessary libraries**

The code starts by importing several Python libraries:
```python
import datetime
import os
import matplotlib as mpl
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from mpl_toolkits.basemap import Basemap
import numpy as np
```
These libraries are used for data manipulation, plotting, and file handling.

**Setting a flag for using NetCDF4**

The code sets a flag `USE_NETCDF4` to `True`, indicating that it will use the NetCDF4 library to read HDF5 files.
```python
USE_NETCDF4 = True
```
**Defining the `run()` function**

The `run()` function takes a file name as input and performs the following tasks:
```python
def run(FILE_NAME):
    ...
```
**Reading the HDF5 file using NetCDF4 (if `USE_NETCDF4` is `True`)**

If `USE_NETCDF4` is `True`, the code uses the NetCDF4 library to read the HDF5 file. It creates a `Dataset` object from the file and navigates through the hierarchy of groups and variables:
```python
    if USE_NETCDF4:
        from netCDF4 import Dataset

        nc = Dataset(FILE_NAME)
        data_var = nc.groups['HDFEOS'].groups['GRIDS'].groups['NCEP'].variables['SST']
        data = data_var[:]
```
**Processing the data**

The code processes the data by:
* Decoding string attributes from bytes to UTF-8 (Python 3 only)
* Applying the fill value (`_FillValue`) to NaN values
* Creating a masked array for visualization

**Plotting the data using Basemap and Matplotlib**

The code uses Basemap and Matplotlib to create an equidistant cylindrical projection of the data:
```python
    m = Basemap(projection='cyl', resolution='l',
                llcrnrlat=-90, urcrnrlat=90,
                llcrnrlon=-180, urcrnrlon=180)
    m.drawcoastlines(linewidth=0.5)
    m.pcolormesh(longitude, latitude, data, latlon=True)
    cb = m.colorbar()
    cb.set_label(data_units)
```
**Saving the plot**

The code saves the plot as a PNG file:
```python
    plt.title('{0}\n{1}'.format(basename, data_longname))
    fig = plt.gcf()
    pngfile = "{0}.py.png".format(basename)    
    fig.savefig(pngfile)
```
I removed some of the less important details and condensed the code to focus on the main implementation. Let me know if you'd like me to make any further changes!
