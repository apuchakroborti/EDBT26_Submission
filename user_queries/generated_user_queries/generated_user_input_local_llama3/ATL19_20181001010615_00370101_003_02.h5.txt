Here is the reduced text while keeping as many implementation details as possible:

**Importing necessary libraries**

1. `import os`
2. `import matplotlib.pyplot as plt`
3. `import numpy as np`
4. `from mpl_toolkits.basemap import Basemap`
5. `import h5py`

**Defining constants and opening the HDF5 file**

1. `FILE_NAME = "ATL19_20181001010615_00370101_003_02.h5"`
2. `with h5py.File(FILE_NAME, mode="r") as f:`

**Accessing datasets within the HDF5 file**

1. Access and extract datasets for latitude (`latvar`), longitude (`lonvar`), and data (`datavar`)
2. Replace `_FillValue` with NaN in the `data` array
3. Create a masked array from the original `data` array

**Creating a map using Basemap**

1. Create an instance of the `Basemap` class
2. Draw coastlines, grid lines, and create a pseudocolor plot (pcolormesh) of the data onto the map

**Adding a colorbar and title**

1. Add a colorbar to the bottom of the plot
2. Set the label for the colorbar using attributes from the HDF5 dataset
3. Create a title for the plot, including filename and long name attributes from the HDF5 dataset

**Saving the plot as an image**

1. Extract the base filename from the full path of the HDF5 file
2. Construct a filename for the saved plot
3. Save the plot as an image file with the constructed filename
