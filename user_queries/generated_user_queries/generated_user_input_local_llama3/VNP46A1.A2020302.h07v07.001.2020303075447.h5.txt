**Accessing LAADS VNP46A1 HDF-EOS5 Geographic projection Grid file**

This Python code reads and visualizes a LAADS VNP46A1 HDF-EOS5 Geographic projection Grid file. Here's an overview:

**Importing libraries**

The code imports:
- `os` for operating system functions
- `re` for regular expressions
- `h5py` for working with HDF5 files
- NumPy (`np`) and Matplotlib (`mpl`) for plotting

**Defining variables and opening file**

It defines:
- `FILE_NAME`: the name of the HDF5 file to be read
- `GRID_NAME` and `DATAFIELD_NAME`: used to access specific datasets within the HDF5 file

The code opens the HDF5 file using `h5py.File(FILE_NAME, mode='r')`.

**Accessing data and metadata**

Within the `with` block:
- It accesses a dataset containing brightness temperature data
- Reads attributes from this dataset (scale factor, offset, units, fill value, long name)
- Reads metadata from 'StructMetadata.0' dataset

**Constructing grid and processing data**

The code extracts upper left and lower right point coordinates from the metadata string to define the grid extent.
- Creates a grid by generating x and y values using these coordinates
- Replaces fill value with NaN, scales data using scale factor and adds offset, and masks NaN values

**Plotting and saving**

It uses Matplotlib's Basemap toolkit to create a map of the grid:
- Draws coastlines, parallels, and meridians on the map
- Plots every 10th point from the data using `pcolormesh`
- Adds a color bar to the plot
- Saves the plot as a PNG file with a name matching the HDF5 file's base name

Overall, this code demonstrates how to access and visualize data from an HDF5 file using Python.
