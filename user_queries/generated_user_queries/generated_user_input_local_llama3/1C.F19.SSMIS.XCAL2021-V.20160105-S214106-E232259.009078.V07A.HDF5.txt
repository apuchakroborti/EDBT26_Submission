Here is the reduced text while keeping as many implementation details as possible:

**Importing necessary modules**

The script starts by importing several Python modules:

* `os`
* `matplotlib` (as `mpl`) and its plotting module (`matplotlib.pyplot` as `plt`)
* `numpy` (as `np`)
* `h5py`

**Defining the file name and opening the HDF5 file**

The script defines the file name and opens the file in read mode using `h5py.File`.

**Accessing data from the HDF5 file**

The script accesses a dataset named `/S1/Tc` from the file. It extracts:

* `data`
* `units` (decoded from the HDF5 attribute)
* `long_name` (decoded from the HDF5 attribute)
* `_FillValue` (decoded from the HDF5 attribute)

**Accessing geolocation data**

The script accesses two datasets:

* `/S1/Latitude`: containing latitude values
* `/S1/Longitude`: containing longitude values

These are used to create a scatter plot of the data.

**Creating a Basemap and plotting the data**

The script creates a `Basemap` object using the `cyl` projection. The map is set up to cover the entire globe.

The script then:

* Draws coastlines on the map
* Draws parallels and meridians on the map
* Creates a scatter plot of the data using longitude, latitude, and data values
* Sets up a color bar for the plot

**Saving the plot**

The script saves the plot as a PNG file named after the file name (without the extension). The title includes the file name, long name of the variable, and "nchannel1=0".

That's it! This script provides an example of how to access and visualize a GPM L1C HDF5 file in Python.
