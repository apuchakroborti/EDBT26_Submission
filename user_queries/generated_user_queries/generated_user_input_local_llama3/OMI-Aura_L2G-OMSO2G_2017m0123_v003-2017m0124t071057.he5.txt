Here is the reduced text, keeping as many implementation details as possible:

**Importing necessary libraries**

The first two lines import the `matplotlib` and `numpy` libraries for plotting and numerical computations.

```python
import os
import matplotlib as mpl
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from mpl_toolkits.basemap import Basemap
import numpy as np
import h5py
```

**Opening the HDF-EOS5 file**

The code opens the HDF-EOS5 file using `h5py` and assigns it to a variable `f`.

```python
with h5py.File(FILE_NAME, mode='r') as f:
    ...
```

**Accessing datasets**

The code accesses three datasets: `ColumnAmountSO2_PBL`, `Latitude`, and `Longitude`.

```python
dset = f[DATAFIELD_NAME]
data = dset[:]
lat = f[LAT_NAME][:]
lon = f[LON_NAME][:]

PATH_NAME = '/HDFEOS/GRIDS/OMI Total Column Amount SO2/Data Fields/'
DATAFIELD_NAME = PATH_NAME + 'ColumnAmountSO2_PBL'
LAT_NAME = PATH_NAME + 'Latitude'
LON_NAME = PATH_NAME + 'Longitude'
```

**Plotting**

The code creates a scatter plot using `Basemap`. The x and y coordinates are set to `lon` and `lat`, respectively. The color of each point is set to the corresponding value in the `data` array.

```python
m.drawcoastlines(linewidth=0.5)
m.drawparallels(np.arange(-90., 120., 30.), labels=[1, 0, 0, 0])
m.drawmeridians(np.arange(-180, 180., 45.), labels=[0, 0, 0, 1])
m.scatter(lon, lat, c=data, s=0.1, cmap=plt.cm.jet,
          edgecolors=None, linewidth=0)
```

**Adding a colorbar and saving the plot**

The code adds a colorbar to the plot using `colorbar` and saves the plot as a PNG file.

```python
cb = m.colorbar()
cb.set_label(units)

basename = os.path.basename(FILE_NAME)
plt.title('{0}\n{1}'.format(basename, title+' at nCandidate=0'))

fig = plt.gcf()
pngfile = "{0}.py.png".format(basename)
fig.savefig(pngfile)
```

I removed the parts that were not directly related to the plotting and data access. Let me know if you'd like me to make any further changes!
