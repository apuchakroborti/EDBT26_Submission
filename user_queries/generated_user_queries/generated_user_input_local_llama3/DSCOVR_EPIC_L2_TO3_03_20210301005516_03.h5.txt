Here is the reduced text while keeping as many implementation details as possible:

**Importing necessary libraries**

The first few lines import various libraries:
```python
import os
import h5py
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import cartopy.crs as ccrs
import numpy as np
```
These libraries are used for file I/O (h5py), data visualization (matplotlib and cartopy), and numerical computations (numpy).

**Opening the HDF5 file**

The code opens an HDF5 file named `DSCOVR_EPIC_L2_TO3_03_20210301005516_03.h5` using the h5py library:
```python
FILE_NAME = 'DSCOVR_EPIC_L2_TO3_03_20210301005516_03.h5'
with h5py.File(FILE_NAME, mode='r') as f:
    ...
```
The `mode='r'` argument specifies that we want to open the file in read-only mode.

**Reading data and attributes**

Within the file-opening context manager, the code reads a dataset named `/Ozone` from the file:
```python
name = '/Ozone'
data = f[name][:].astype(np.float64)
```
The `f[name]` expression accesses the `/Ozone` dataset within the HDF5 file. The `.astype(np.float64)` method converts the data to a floating-point array with 64-bit precision.

**Plotting on the map**

The code plots the ozone data as a scatter plot using `plt.scatter`:
```python
p = plt.scatter(lon, lat, c=data, s=1, cmap=plt.cm.jet,
                transform=ccrs.PlateCarree())
```
This plot uses the longitude and latitude values to create a 2D map. The `c` argument specifies that we want to color the points based on the ozone data.

**Adding grids, coastlines, and degree labels**

The code adds grid lines, coastlines, and degree labels to the map using various cartopy functions:
```python
gl = ax.gridlines()
ax.coastlines()
gl.xformatter = LONGITUDE_FORMATTER
gl.yformatter = LATITUDE_FORMATTER
```
These features help visualize the map and provide context for the ozone data.

**Creating a colorbar**

The code creates a colorbar using `plt.colorbar`:
```python
cb = plt.colorbar(p, fraction=0.022, pad=0.01)
cb.set_label(units, fontsize=8)
```
This colorbar is labeled with the units attribute (`'DU'`) and has a specific size and position.

**Adding title and saving image**

The code adds a title to the plot using `plt.title`:
```python
basename = os.path.basename(FILE_NAME)
plt.title('{0}\n{1}'.format(basename, long_name), fontsize=12)
```
This title includes the file name and the long name attribute.

Finally, the code saves the image as a PNG file:
```python
pngfile = "{0}.py.png".format(basename)
fig.savefig(pngfile)
```
This step creates an image file with the same base name as the input HDF5 file, but with a `.py.png` extension.
