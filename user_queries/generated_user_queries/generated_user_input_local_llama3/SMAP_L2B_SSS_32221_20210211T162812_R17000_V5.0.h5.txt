Here is the reduced text while keeping as many implementation details as possible:

**Importing necessary libraries**

The code imports various Python libraries:
* `os` for interacting with the operating system.
* `matplotlib` (aliased as `mpl`) and its module `pyplot` (aliased as `plt`) for plotting.
* `Basemap` for creating maps.
* `numpy` (aliased as `np`) for numerical computations.

**Importing HDF5 library**

The code imports the `h5py` library:
```python
import h5py
```

**Defining file name and opening HDF5 file**

The code defines a file name (`FILE_NAME`) and opens an HDF5 file using `h5py`:
```python
with h5py.File(FILE_NAME, mode='r') as f:
    ...
```

**Accessing dataset variables**

Inside the `with` block, the code accesses several datasets within the HDF5 file:
```python
latvar = f['/lat']
latitude = latvar[:]
...
```
Here's what each line does:

* Access the `/lat` dataset and extract its values as a NumPy array.

**Handling FillValue**

The code handles the `FillValue` attribute in the dataset:
```python
data[data == _FillValue] = np.nan
data = np.ma.masked_where(np.isnan(data), data)
```
Here's what each line does:

* Replace `FillValue` with NaN values in the data, then mask out any NaN values.

**Creating a map**

The code creates an equidistant cylindrical projection using the Basemap library:
```python
m = Basemap(projection='cyl', resolution='l',
            llcrnrlat=-90, urcrnrlat=90,
            llcrnrlon=-180, urcrnrlon=180)
...
```
Here's what each line does:

* Create a Basemap object with the specified projection and resolution.
* Draw coastlines, parallels, and meridians on the map.

**Plotting data**

The code plots the data on the map:
```python
m.scatter(longitude, latitude, c=data, s=1, cmap=plt.cm.jet,
          edgecolors=None, linewidth=0)
...
```
Here's what each line does:

* Plot the data as a scatter plot on the map.

**Adding labels and title**

The code adds labels and a title to the plot:
```python
plt.title('{0}\n{1}'.format(basename, long_name))
...
```
Here's what each line does:

* Set the title of the plot with the file name and long name.

**Saving the plot**

The code saves the plot as a PNG image:
```python
fig.savefig(pngfile)
```
Here's what each line does:

* Save the plot to a PNG file with the specified name.
