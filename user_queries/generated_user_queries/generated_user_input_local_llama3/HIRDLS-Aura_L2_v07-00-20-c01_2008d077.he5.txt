Here is the reduced text while keeping as many implementation details as possible:

This Python code accesses and visualizes a GES DISC HIRDLS HDF-EOS5 swath file.

**Importing necessary modules**

The first four lines import necessary modules:
- `datetime` for date and time operations
- `os` for operating system-specific functions
- `matplotlib` (imported as `mpl`) and its sub-module `pyplot` for creating plots
- `numpy` (`np`) for numerical operations

**Setting the file name**

The next line sets the file name to `'HIRDLS-Aura_L2_v07-00-20-c01_2008d077.he5'`.

**Opening and accessing datasets**

The code opens the HDF5 file in read mode using `h5py`. It accesses three datasets:
- `dset_var`: ozone concentration data
- `dset_pres`: pressure data
- `dset_time`: time data

**Reading and handling data**

The code reads data from these datasets. It handles fill values by replacing them with NaN (Not a Number) in the ozone concentration data.

**Converting date and time**

The code converts the six-digit number stored as `time` into a string using `datetime`.

**Creating the plot**

The code creates a plot of ozone concentration versus pressure.

**Customizing the plot**

The code customizes the plot:
- Sets x-axis labels to use scientific notation
- Sets title and axis labels
- Inverts y-axis for high pressures at the bottom
- Uses log scale on y-axis with formatted tick labels

**Saving the plot**

Finally, the code saves the plot as a PNG file with the same name as the HDF5 file but with a `.py.png` extension.
