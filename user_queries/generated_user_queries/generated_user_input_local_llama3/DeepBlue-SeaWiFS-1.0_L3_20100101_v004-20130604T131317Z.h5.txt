Here is the reduced text, keeping as many implementation details as possible:

This Python script accesses and visualizes a GES DISC MEaSUREs SeaWiFS L3 grid file in Python. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. **Importing Libraries**: The script imports necessary libraries:
    - `os`: for operating system-related functions
    - `matplotlib` (as `mpl`) and `matplotlib.pyplot` (as `plt`): for plotting and visualization
    - `Basemap`: from the `mpl_toolkits.basemap` module, which provides a toolkit for creating maps
    - `numpy` (as `np`): for numerical operations
    - `h5py`: for working with HDF5 files

2. **Defining File Name**: The script defines the name of the HDF5 file to be accessed: `'DeepBlue-SeaWiFS-1.0_L3_20100101_v004-20130604T131317Z.h5'`

3. **Opening the HDF5 File**: The script opens the HDF5 file in read mode (`'r'`) using `h5py.File()`.

4. **Accessing Data and Coordinates**: Within the file object, the script accesses three datasets:
    - `'aerosol_optical_thickness_550_ocean'`: This is the main dataset containing aerosol optical thickness data.
    - `latitude` and `longitude`: These are coordinates that describe the spatial location of the data points.

5. **Processing Data**: The script processes the data by replacing `_FillValue` with NaN (Not a Number) and decoding string attributes to UTF-8 using `.decode()`.

6. **Drawing a Map**: The script creates an equidistant cylindrical projection using `Basemap`. It draws coastlines, parallels, and meridians on the map.

7. **Visualizing Data**: The script uses `pcolormesh()` to visualize the aerosol optical thickness data on the map, setting minimum and maximum values for color mapping.

8. **Adding a Color Bar** and **Creating a Plot Title**: The script adds a color bar and sets the title of the plot using `plt.title()` with the file name and long name as arguments.

9. **Saving the Plot**: Finally, the script saves the plot as a PNG image (`fig.savefig(pngfile)`) with the same base name as the input HDF5 file, but with a `.py.png` extension.

This script provides an example of how to access and visualize a GES DISC MEaSUREs SeaWiFS L3 grid file in Python.
