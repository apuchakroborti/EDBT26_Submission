Here is the reduced text, keeping as many implementation details as possible:

**Importing necessary libraries**

The code starts by importing several Python libraries:

1. `os`: for working with operating system-related functions
2. `h5py`: for reading and writing HDF5 files
3. `numpy` (`np`): for numerical computations
4. `matplotlib` (`mpl`) and its plotting library (`pyplot` as `plt`): for creating plots

**Defining the file name**

The code defines a constant `FILE_NAME` with the path to an HDF5 file:

```python
FILE_NAME = 'oco2_L2StdND_03949a_150330_B8100r_170916014809.h5'
```

This file is expected to be in the current working directory.

**Opening and accessing data**

The code opens the HDF5 file using `h5py`:

```python
with h5py.File(FILE_NAME, mode='r') as f:
    ...
```

Inside the `with` block:

1. We access a dataset named `/RetrievalResults/xco2` using `f[name][:]`.
2. We extract units and long name from the dataset's attributes.
3. We access geolocation data: latitude and longitude values.

**Creating a Basemap plot**

We create a Basemap object with:

1. A cylindrical (Mercator) projection
2. Low-resolution coastlines
3. Latitude and longitude limits

The `Basemap` object is used to:
1. Draw coastlines
2. Draw parallels and meridians
3. Scatter plot data points (`m.scatter(longitude, latitude, c=data, s=1, cmap=plt.cm.jet)`)

**Adding title and saving plot**

We:
1. Set the title of the plot using `plt.title('{0}\n{1}'.format(basename, longname))`.
2. Save the plot as a PNG image.

The resulting plot has a title, color bar, and data points in a Basemap layout.
