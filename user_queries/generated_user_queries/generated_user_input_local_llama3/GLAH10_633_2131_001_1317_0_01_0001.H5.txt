Here is the reduced text while keeping as many implementation details as possible:

**Importing necessary modules**

The script starts by importing several modules: `os`, `matplotlib`, `Basemap` from `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, and `numpy`.

**Defining a function to run**

A function named `run` is defined, which takes one argument, `FILE_NAME`. This function will be used to access and visualize the NSIDC ICESat/GLAS GLAH10 L2 HDF5 file.

**Accessing HDF5 file using netCDF4 or h5py**

The script uses either `netCDF4` or `h5py` to access the HDF5 file, depending on the value of `USE_NETCDF4`. If `USE_NETCDF4` is `True`, it uses `netCDF4` to:

1. Create a `Dataset` object for the specified file name (`FILE_NAME`).
2. Access groups and variables within the file using dot notation.

The script extracts variables: `latitude`, `longitude`, `temp`, and `time`.

**Drawing an equidistant cylindrical projection**

The script uses `Basemap` to draw an equidistant cylindrical projection of the Earth, including coastlines, parallels, and meridians.

**Plotting data and saving the plot**

The script plots temperature values (`temp`) as colored points on the map using `matplotlib`, with a color bar (CB). The plot is saved as a PNG file named after the input HDF5 file.

This code provides an example of how to access and visualize an NSIDC ICESat/GLAS GLAH10 L2 HDF5 file in Python, using either `netCDF4` or `h5py`.
