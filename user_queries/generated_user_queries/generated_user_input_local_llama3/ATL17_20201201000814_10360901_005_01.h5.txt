Here is the text reduced by 20% while keeping as many implementation details as possible:

**Importing necessary libraries**

The first four lines import various libraries:
1. `os`: a built-in Python library for interacting with the operating system.
2. `matplotlib.pyplot` (imported as `plt`): a plotting library.
3. `numpy` (imported as `np`): a numerical computing library.

**Defining constants and opening HDF5 file**

The next line defines a constant `FILE_NAME`, which is the name of an HDF5 file to be read. The code then opens the HDF5 file using the `h5py` library, specifying the mode as "read-only" (`mode="r"`).

**Accessing variables from the HDF5 file and handling FillValue**

The code accesses several variables from the HDF5 file:
1. `latvar` and `latitude`: these are the latitude values.
2. `lonvar` and `longitude`: these are the longitude values.

It also handles the `_FillValue` attribute by replacing its value with NaN (Not a Number) in the `data` array. Then, it creates a masked array (`np.ma.masked_where`) to ignore these NaN values.

**Creating a map and plotting data**

The code uses the `Basemap` library to create an equidistant cylindrical projection. The map is configured with:
1. Projection: "cyl" (cylindrical).
2. Resolution: "l" (low).

The code then draws coastlines, parallels, and meridians on the map using various methods.

It also plots the `data` array on the map using `m.pcolormesh`. The `latlon=True` argument ensures that the x and y coordinates are interpreted as latitude and longitude, respectively.

**Adding a color bar and saving the figure**

The code adds a color bar to the plot using `m.colorbar(location="bottom")`. It also saves the figure as a PNG file named `{0}.py.png`, where `{0}` is the base name of the HDF5 file.
