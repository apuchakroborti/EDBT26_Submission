Here is the reduced text while keeping as many implementation details as possible:

**Importing necessary modules**

The code starts by importing several Python modules:
```python
import os
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from mpl_toolkits.basemap import Basemap
import numpy as np
import h5py
```
These modules are used for various tasks, such as file operations (os), plotting (matplotlib), geospatial visualization (Basemap), numerical computations (numpy), and HDF5 file handling (h5py).

**Defining constants**

The code defines two constants:
```python
FILE_NAME = 'OMI-Aura_L3-OMTO3e_2017m0105_v003-2017m0203t091906.he5'
DATAFIELD_NAME = '/HDFEOS/GRIDS/OMI Column Amount O3/Data Fields/ColumnAmountO3'
```
These constants represent the name of the HDF5 file to be read and the path to a specific dataset within that file.

**Opening the HDF5 file**

The code opens the HDF5 file using the `h5py` module:
```python
with h5py.File(FILE_NAME, mode='r') as f:
    ...
```
This code opens the file in read-only mode (`mode='r'`) and assigns it to a variable `f`.

**Reading the dataset**

The code reads the dataset specified by `DATAFIELD_NAME`:
```python
dset = f[DATAFIELD_NAME]
data = dset[:]
```

**Processing the data**

The code processes the dataset by replacing fill values with NaN (Not a Number) and creating a masked array.

**Getting attributes**

The code retrieves two attributes from the dataset: `Title` and `Units`. These attributes are decoded from bytes to UTF-8 strings:
```python
title = dset.attrs['Title'].decode()
units = dset.attrs['Units'].decode()
```

**Plotting**

The code uses the `Basemap` module to create an equidistant cylindrical projection:
```python
m = Basemap(projection='cyl', resolution='l',
            llcrnrlat=-90, urcrnrlat = 90,
            llcrnrlon=-180, urcrnrlon = 180)
```
The code then draws coastlines and adds latitude and longitude labels:
```python
m.drawcoastlines(linewidth=0.5)
m.drawparallels(np.arange(-90., 120., 30.), labels=[1, 0, 0, 0])
m.drawmeridians(np.arange(-180, 180., 45.), labels=[0, 0, 0, 1])
```
The code also creates a pseudocolor plot of the data using `pcolormesh`:
```python
m.pcolormesh(longitude, latitude, data, latlon=True, cmap='jet')
```

**Saving the plot**

The code saves the plot as a PNG file:
```python
basename = os.path.basename(FILE_NAME)
plt.title('{0}\n{1}'.format(basename, title))
fig = plt.gcf()
pngfile = "{0}.py.png".format(basename)
fig.savefig(pngfile)
```
This code generates a title for the plot using the file name and attribute values. It then saves the plot as a PNG file with the same base name as the HDF5 file.

That's it! The code reads an HDF5 file, processes its contents, and creates a pseudocolor plot of the data.
