Generate a Python script named `graph_generate_from_hdf5_file.py` and save it in `/Users/apukumarchakroborti/gsu_research/llam_test/des_to_code`. The script should take a hdf5 file from the `/Users/apukumarchakroborti/gsu_research/llam_test` directory, generate code, and save it in the `des_to_code` directory with the same name but prefixed with `llam`.
Please generate a Python script that reads a JSON file located at `/home/user/data/config.json`, modifies a key-value pair, and writes the modified JSON to the same directory with the file name `config_updated.json`.
Generate a Python script that saves output to the following path: `/home/user/data/processed_data.csv`. The code should create this file if it doesn't exist.
I have an H5 file with temperature data. How can I read this dataset and create a time-series plot using Python? I'd also like to label the axes with the appropriate units. hdf5 file_path = '/Users/apukumarchakroborti/gsu_research/llam_test/LaRC' hdf5 file_name ='TES-Aura_L3-CH4_r0000033028_C01_F01_12.he5'
Can you help me generate comparison graphs between two datasets inside an HDF5 file? I want to plot them on the same grap hdf5_file_path = '/Users/apukumarchakroborti/gsu_research/llam_test/LaRC' hdf5 file_name ='TES-Aura_L3-CH4_r0000033028_C01_F01_12.he5'
How do I plot data from an H5 file while incorporating metadata like labels or timestamps stored in the file? I want to generate a labeled line chart. input_file_path ='/Users/apukumarchakroborti/gsu_research/llam_test/LaRC' hdf5_file_path = '/Users/apukumarchakroborti/gsu_research/llam_test/LaRC' hdf5 file_name ='TES-Aura_L3-CH4_r0000033028_C01_F01_12.he5'
I want to generate a histogram to show the distribution of values in one of the datasets in my HDF5 file. Could you show me how to do this in Python? graph_file_path = '/Users/apukumarchakroborti/gsu_research/llam_test/LaRC'hdf5_file_path = '/Users/apukumarchakroborti/gsu_research/llam_test/LaRC' hdf5 file_name ='TES-Aura_L3-CH4_r0000033028_C01_F01_12.he5'
Can you guide me on how to create different types of graphs like scatter plots and bar charts from an HDF5 data source? I have multiple groups and datasets within the file. graph_file_name hdf5_file_path = '/Users/apukumarchakroborti/gsu_research/llam_test/LaRC' hdf5 graph file file_name ='TES-Aura_L3-CH4_r0000033028_C01_F01_12.he5'
