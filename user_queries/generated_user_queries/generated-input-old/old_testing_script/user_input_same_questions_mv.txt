Generate a Python script named `graph_generate_from_hdf5_file.py` and save it in `/Users/apukumarchakroborti/gsu_research/llam_test/des_to_code`. The script should take a hdf5 file from the `/Users/apukumarchakroborti/gsu_research/llam_test/LaRC` directory, read data from given he5 file, group name is Sample0 and dataset is latitude, generate heatmap from this dataset and save it in the `des_to_code` directory with the same name but prefixed with `llam`. Please don't ask user to give input as an argument, file name is already given as input_file_name is TES-Aura_L3-CH4_r0000033028_C01_F01_12.he5
