How can I generate graphs from the data stored in an HDF5 file? I have several datasets inside, and I'd like to visualize them using matplotlib or another library.  hdf5 FILE PATH is '/Users/apukumarchakroborti/gsu_research/llam_test/LaRC' hdf5 FILE NAME is 'TES-Aura_L3-CH4_r0000033028_C01_F01_12.he5'
I have an H5 file with temperature data. How can I read this dataset and create a time-series plot using Python? I'd also like to label the axes with the appropriate units. hdf5 file_path = '/Users/apukumarchakroborti/gsu_research/llam_test/LaRC' hdf5 file_name ='TES-Aura_L3-CH4_r0000033028_C01_F01_12.he5'
Can you help me generate comparison graphs between two datasets inside an HDF5 file? I want to plot them on the same grap hdf5_file_path = '/Users/apukumarchakroborti/gsu_research/llam_test/LaRC' hdf5 file_name ='TES-Aura_L3-CH4_r0000033028_C01_F01_12.he5'
How do I plot data from an H5 file while incorporating metadata like labels or timestamps stored in the file? I want to generate a labeled line chart. hdf5_file_path = '/Users/apukumarchakroborti/gsu_research/llam_test/LaRC' hdf5 file_name ='TES-Aura_L3-CH4_r0000033028_C01_F01_12.he5'
I want to generate a histogram to show the distribution of values in one of the datasets in my HDF5 file. Could you show me how to do this in Python? hdf5_file_path = '/Users/apukumarchakroborti/gsu_research/llam_test/LaRC' hdf5 file_name ='TES-Aura_L3-CH4_r0000033028_C01_F01_12.he5'
Can you guide me on how to create different types of graphs like scatter plots and bar charts from an HDF5 data source? I have multiple groups and datasets within the file. hdf5_file_path = '/Users/apukumarchakroborti/gsu_research/llam_test/LaRC' hdf5 file_name ='TES-Aura_L3-CH4_r0000033028_C01_F01_12.he5'
