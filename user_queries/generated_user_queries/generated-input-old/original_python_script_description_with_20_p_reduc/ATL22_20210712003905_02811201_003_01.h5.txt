Here is the reduced description, keeping as many implementation details as possible:

**Step 1: Importing necessary libraries**

The code imports several Python libraries:
* `os` for interacting with the operating system
* `matplotlib.pyplot` as `plt` for creating plots and visualizations
* `numpy` as `np` for numerical computations and data manipulation
* `mpl_toolkits.basemap` as `Basemap` for creating maps and geographic visualizations
* `h5py` for reading and manipulating HDF5 files

**Step 2-3: Setting file name and path, and opening the HDF5 file**

The code sets a variable `FILE_NAME` to the path of an HDF5 file in the current working directory. It then opens the HDF5 file in read-only mode using `h5py`.

**Step 4-5: Reading datasets and extracting attributes**

The code reads three datasets from the HDF5 file:
* `/gt1l/transect_lat` and `/gt1l/transect_lon`, which are extracted into arrays called `latitude` and `longitude`.
* `/gt1l/inland_water_body_type`, which is assigned to `datavar`. The code extracts several attributes from this dataset, including `units`, `long_name`, and `_FillValue`.

**Step 6: Handling FillValues**

The code converts the `data` array to floating-point numbers and replaces all occurrences of `_FillValue` with NaN values. It then creates a masked array `dataf` where NaN values are excluded.

**Step 7-8: Creating a map and plotting data**

The code uses `Basemap` to create an equidistant cylindrical projection map, specifying various parameters such as the type of projection, resolution, latitude range, and longitude range. It then plots the `dataf` array on the map using `m.scatter()`.

**Step 9-10: Adding a colorbar, title, and saving the plot**

The code adds a colorbar at the bottom of the plot, sets the label for the colorbar, and sets the title of the plot. Finally, it saves the plot to a PNG file with a name derived from the input HDF5 file name.

That's it!
