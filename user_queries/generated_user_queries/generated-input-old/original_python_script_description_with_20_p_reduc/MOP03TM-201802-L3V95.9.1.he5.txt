Here is the reduced description, keeping as many implementation details as possible:

**Importing modules**

The code imports several Python modules: `os`, `h5py`, `numpy` as `np`, `matplotlib` as `mpl`, `matplotlib.pyplot` as `plt`, and `Basemap`.

**Setting file paths and names**

Two variables are set: `FILE_PATH` to the directory where the HDF5 file is located, and `FILE_NAME` to the full path and name of the HDF5 file.

**Opening the HDF5 file and accessing datasets**

The script opens the HDF5 file in read mode using `h5py.File` and accesses several datasets and attributes: `/HDFEOS/GRIDS/MOP03/Data Fields`, `RetrievedSurfaceTemperatureDay`, `Latitude`, and `Longitude`. The entire dataset is read into memory, and attributes like `longname`, `units`, and `fillvalue` are accessed.

**Data processing**

The script replaces fill values with NaN and creates a masked array using `np.ma.masked_array`.

**Creating a Basemap object and plotting the data**

A `Basemap` object is created with cylindrical projection, low resolution, and latitude/longitude limits. The script plots the data using `drawcoastlines`, `drawparallels`, `drawmeridians`, and `pcolormesh`.

**Adding a colorbar and title**

The script adds a colorbar with a label set to the units of the dataset and a title consisting of the file name and long name of the dataset.

**Saving the plot to a PNG file**

Finally, the script saves the plot to a PNG file using `fig.savefig`, with the file name constructed by concatenating the file path, the base name of the HDF5 file, and `.py.png`.
