Here is the reduced text while keeping as many implementation details as possible:

This Python script reads and visualizes data from an NSIDC AMSR_U2 L3 SeaIce25km HDF-EOS5 Grid file.

**Importing modules**

The script imports various Python modules, including `os`, `re`, `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, `pyproj`, and `numpy`.

**Defining constants**

The script defines a few constants: `USE_GDAL` (a boolean flag indicating whether to use the GDAL library), `DATAFIELD_NAME` (the name of the data field in the HDF-EOS5 file), and `GRID_NAME` (the name of the grid in the HDF-EOS5 file).

**Defining the `run` function**

The `run` function takes a single argument, `FILE_NAME`, which is the path to the HDF-EOS5 file. The function performs the following steps:

1. Identify the data field using `DATAFIELD_NAME` and `GRID_NAME`.
2. Read data using GDAL (if enabled) or h5py (if not).
3. Set projection parameters manually if using GDAL.
4. Construct the grid by extracting extents from metadata using regular expressions.
5. Process data by replacing zeros with NaN values, scaling by 0.1, and creating a masked array.
6. Create x and y coordinates using `np.linspace` and `np.meshgrid`.
7. Transform EASE Grid to WGS84 using `pyproj`.
8. Create a Basemap plot, add coastlines, parallels, and meridians, and plot the data using `pcolormesh`.
9. Add a colorbar and title to the plot.
10. Save the plot to a PNG file.

**Main script**

The main script calls the `run` function with the HDF-EOS5 file name as an argument.

This script demonstrates how to read data from an HDF-EOS5 file, process it, and visualize it using Basemap.
