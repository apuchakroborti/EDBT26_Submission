Here is the reduced description, condensed by 20% while keeping implementation details:

**Importing necessary libraries**

The code imports several Python libraries: `os`, `matplotlib` and `matplotlib.pyplot` for visualizations, `numpy` for numerical computations, `mpl_toolkits.basemap` for creating maps, and `h5py` for reading HDF5 files.

**Setting font size and defining constants**

The code sets the font size to 9 using `matplotlib`'s `rcParams`. Two constants are defined: `FILE_NAME`, the name of the HDF5 file, and `name`, the path to the dataset "/S1/Tb".

**Opening HDF5 file and reading dataset**

The code opens the HDF5 file in read-only mode using `h5py` and reads a dataset from it. The actual data values are stored in a NumPy array, and the units and fill value are read from the dataset's attributes.

**Getting geolocation data and creating a map**

The code reads latitude and longitude values from the HDF5 file and creates a Basemap object with a cylindrical projection, low resolution, and a specific latitude and longitude range. Coastlines, parallels, and meridians are added to the map.

**Plotting data and adding a colorbar**

The code plots the data using `m.scatter`, with longitude and latitude values as x and y coordinates, and data values used to color the points. A colorbar is added to the plot, located at the bottom, with a label set to the units of the dataset.

**Setting title and saving figure**

The code sets the title of the plot using the file name and dataset name, and saves the figure as a PNG file with the same base name as the HDF5 file.
