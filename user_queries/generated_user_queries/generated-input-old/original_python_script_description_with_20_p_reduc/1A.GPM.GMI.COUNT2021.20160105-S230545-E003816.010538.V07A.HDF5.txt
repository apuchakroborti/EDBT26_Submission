Here is the reduced text, keeping as many implementation details as possible:

**Importing necessary libraries**

The code imports several Python libraries: `os`, `matplotlib` and `matplotlib.pyplot` (as `mpl` and `plt`), `numpy` (as `np`), `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, and `h5py`.

**Configuring Matplotlib**

The font size of Matplotlib is set to 9 using `mpl.rcParams.update({"font.size": 9})`.

**Defining constants and variables**

The code defines several constants and variables: `FILE_NAME`, the name of the HDF5 file, and `name`, the path to a dataset within the HDF5 file.

**Reading HDF5 file and extracting data**

The code opens the HDF5 file in read mode using `h5py.File(FILE_NAME, mode="r") as f:`. It extracts `data` (values of the dataset), `units` (decoded from a byte string), and `_FillValue` (fill value of the dataset). All occurrences of `_FillValue` in `data` are replaced with `NaN`.

**Extracting geolocation data**

The code extracts latitude and longitude datasets from the HDF5 file.

**Creating a Basemap instance**

A Basemap instance is created using `Basemap` from `mpl_toolkits.basemap`. The map is configured with a cylindrical projection, low-resolution coastline, and specific latitude and longitude bounds.

**Plotting data**

The code plots the data using `m.drawcoastlines`, `m.drawparallels`, `m.drawmeridians`, and `m.scatter`.

**Adding colorbar and title**

A colorbar is added at the bottom of the plot with a 10% padding, and the label is set to the units of the dataset. The title is set to include the file name and dataset name.

**Saving the figure**

The figure is saved to a PNG file using `plt.gcf()` and `fig.savefig(pngfile)`.

This reduced text still provides a clear overview of the code's implementation details, while removing some of the extraneous explanations and examples.
