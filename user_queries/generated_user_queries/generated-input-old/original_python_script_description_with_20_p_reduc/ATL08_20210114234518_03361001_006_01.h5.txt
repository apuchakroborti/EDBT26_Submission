Here is the reduced description, keeping as many implementation details as possible:

**Importing necessary libraries**

The code imports several Python libraries: `os`, `cartopy.crs` for cartographic projections, `matplotlib.pyplot` for creating plots, `numpy` for numerical computations, and `h5py` for working with HDF5 files.

**Defining constants and file paths**

The code defines the path to the HDF5 file (`FILE_NAME`) and opens it in read mode using `h5py`.

**Accessing datasets within the HDF5 file**

The code accesses several datasets: `latitude`, `longitude`, and `dem_h` within the `/gt1l/land_segments` group. It extracts data from these datasets into NumPy arrays and retrieves metadata such as units, long name, and fill value.

**Handling FillValue and masking**

The code replaces fill values with NaN and masks NaN values in the data using `numpy`.

**Finding the middle location**

The code finds the middle latitude and longitude values by calculating the midpoint of the data arrays.

**Setting up the map projection**

The code sets up an orthographic map projection using Cartopy, defining the central longitude and latitude based on the middle location.

**Plotting the data**

The code plots the data on the map using `matplotlib`, creating a scatter plot with a Plate Carree projection. It adds features such as grid lines, coastlines, and a colorbar to the plot.

**Saving the plot to a PNG file**

The code saves the plot to a PNG file using `matplotlib`.
