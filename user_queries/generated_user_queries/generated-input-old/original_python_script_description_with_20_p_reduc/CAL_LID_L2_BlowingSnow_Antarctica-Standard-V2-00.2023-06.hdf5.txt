Here is the rewritten description with 20% less text while keeping as many implementation details as possible:

Let's break down this Python code step-by-step:

**Comments and Header**
The code starts with a block of comments explaining what the script does, how to use it, and metadata about the script itself.

**Importing Libraries**
The script imports several libraries: `h5py` for HDF5 files, `os` for interacting with the operating system, `cartopy.crs` and `cartopy.mpl.gridliner` for creating maps, `matplotlib.pyplot` (as `plt`) for plots, and `numpy` (as `np`) for numerical computations.

**Defining File Paths and Names**
The script defines two variables: `FILE_PATH` for the directory where the HDF5 file is located, and `FILE_NAME` for the full path to the HDF5 file.

**Opening the HDF5 File and Reading Data**
The script opens the HDF5 file in read-only mode using `h5py`. It reads data from the file:
* `name`: a string specifying the path to the dataset `/Snow_Fields/Blowing_Snow_Depol_Profile`.
* `data`: an array read from the dataset using `f[name][:].astype(np.float64)`.
* `units` and `long_name`: strings read from the attributes of the dataset.
The script also reads geolocation data: `lat` and `lon`.

**Handling Fill Values and Creating a Map Plot**
The script replaces fill values with NaN and creates a masked array using `np.ma.masked_where`. It uses Cartopy to create an orthographic map projection and plots the data on the map using `plt.scatter`.

**Adding Gridlines, Coastlines, and Customizing the Plot**
The script adds gridlines and coastlines to the plot, hides top and right grid labels, sets the format for grid labels, and creates a colorbar.

**Adding a Title and Saving the Plot**
The script adds a title to the plot using the base name of the HDF5 file and the `long_name` string. Finally, it saves the plot to a PNG file constructed from the output file path and name.

That's it!
