Here is the reduced text, keeping as many implementation details as possible:

Let's break down this Python code step-by-step:

**Comments and docstrings**

The code starts with a long comment block providing information about the script.

**Importing modules**

The next section imports various Python modules: `os`, `cartopy.crs as ccrs`, `matplotlib.pyplot as plt`, `numpy as np`, and `h5py`.

**Defining constants**

A constant `FILE_NAME` specifies the path to an HDF5 file.

**Reading HDF5 file**

The script uses `h5py` to read the HDF5 file in read-only mode. Within the file, several datasets are accessed using their full paths: latitude values, longitude values, and height data.

**Accessing attributes**

Attributes of the height dataset are accessed: units, long name, and fill value for missing data.

**Handling FillValue**

Fill values are replaced with NaN (Not a Number) values to handle missing data in visualization.

**Setting up map projection**

An Orthographic map projection is created using Cartopy with central coordinates set from middle latitude and longitude values.

**Plotting data**

The height data is plotted on the map using `matplotlib` with colors representing values.

**Adding gridlines and coastlines**

Gridlines and coastlines are added to the map. Gridlabels are customized to display only at the bottom and left sides of the map.

**Adding colorbar**

A colorbar is added to the plot, sized and positioned using `fraction` and `pad` arguments.

**Setting title**

The plot title combines the HDF5 file name with the long name of the height data.

**Saving figure**

Finally, the plot is saved as a PNG image named after the HDF5 file.
