Here is the reduced description, keeping as many implementation details as possible:

Let's break down this Python code step-by-step:

**Importing Modules**

The code imports several modules: `os`, `h5py`, `matplotlib` (as `mpl`) and `matplotlib.pyplot` (as `plt`), `Basemap`, and `numpy` (as `np`).

**Defining Constants**

Two constants are defined: `FILE_PATH` and `FILE_NAME`, which is constructed by concatenating `FILE_PATH` with the filename.

**Reading the HDF5 File**

The code uses `h5py` to read the HDF5 file in read-only mode (`mode='r'`) and assigns it to a variable `f`. The `with` statement ensures the file is properly closed.

**Extracting Data from the HDF5 File**

Within the `with` block, the code extracts several datasets and attributes: `datavar`, `minv`, `maxv`, and `fv`. It then extracts the entire dataset into a NumPy array `data`.

**Handling Missing Values**

The code replaces missing values with NaN values and handles invalid values by replacing them with NaN values.

**Defining Units and Long Name**

Two variables are defined: `units` ( `'psu'`) and `long_name` (`'Sea Surface Salinity'`).

**Creating a Basemap Object**

A `Basemap` object is created with a cylindrical projection and low-resolution coastline database.

**Drawing the Map and Plotting the Data**

The code uses the `Basemap` object to draw coastlines, parallels, and meridians. It then creates a scatter plot of the data using the `Basemap` object with a jet colormap.

**Colorbar and Title**

A colorbar is added to the plot with its label set to the units string (`'psu'`). The title of the plot is set using the filename and long name.

**Saving the Plot**

The code saves the plot as a PNG file using `matplotlib`.
