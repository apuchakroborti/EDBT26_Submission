Here is the reduced text while keeping as many implementation details as possible:

**Comments and Docstrings**

The code starts with comments and docstrings providing information about the script, its purpose, and how to use it.

**Importing Modules**

The code imports several Python modules: `os`, `h5py`, `numpy` (as `np`), `matplotlib` (as `mpl`) and `matplotlib.pyplot` (as `plt`), and `Basemap`.

**Defining Constants**

The code defines constants: `FILE_NAME`, `DATA_NAME`, and `FIELD_NAME`.

**Reading HDF-EOS File**

The code opens the HDF-EOS file in read-only mode using `h5py` and extracts several datasets.

**Data Processing**

The code replaces `_FillValue` with `NaN` and creates a masked array from the data.

**Creating a Basemap**

The code creates a Basemap instance with a cylindrical projection and low-resolution coastline database.

**Drawing the Map**

The code draws coastlines, parallels, and meridians on the map.

**Scattering Data Points**

The code scatters the data points on the map using `m.scatter`.

**Creating a Colorbar**

The code creates a colorbar using `m.colorbar()`.

**Saving the Plot**

Finally, the code saves the plot to a PNG file with a name derived from the input file name.

I removed some of the explanatory text and condensed the descriptions of each section while keeping the implementation details intact.
