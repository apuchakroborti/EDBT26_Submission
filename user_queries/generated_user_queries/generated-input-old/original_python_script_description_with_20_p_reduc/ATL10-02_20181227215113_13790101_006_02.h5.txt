Here is the reduced text while keeping as many implementation details as possible:

**Comments and Import Statements**

The code starts with comments explaining how to use the script, including the required input file format and library versions used.

The next few lines import necessary libraries:
* `datetime` for date and time operations
* `os` for operating system-related functions
* `matplotlib.pyplot` as `plt` for plotting
* `numpy` as `np` for numerical computations
* `mpl_toolkits.basemap` as `Basemap` for mapping and visualization
* `h5py` for reading HDF5 files

**File Path, HDF5 File Handling, and Dataset Access**

The code sets the file path to an HDF5 file using a variable `FILE_NAME`. The file is opened in read mode (`"r"`), and a context manager (`with` statement) ensures that the file is properly closed.

Within the `with` block, the code accesses various datasets:
* `/gt1r/freeboard_segment/geophysical/latitude`
* `/gt1r/freeboard_segment/geophysical/longitude`
* `/gt1r/freeboard_segment/beam_fb_height`
* `/gt1r/freeboard_segment/geophysical/delta_time`

**Data Processing and Plotting**

The code processes the data by handling fill values with NaN and masking the data using `np.ma.masked_where`. It then creates two plots:
1. **Time vs. Height Plot**: A plot is created with time on the x-axis and beam FB height on the y-axis.
2. **Trajectory Plot**: A Basemap plot is created, showing the trajectory of the flight path.

**Saving the Plot**

The final plot is saved as a PNG file with a name derived from the input HDF5 file name.

This script reads an HDF5 file, extracts specific datasets, processes the data, and creates two plots.
