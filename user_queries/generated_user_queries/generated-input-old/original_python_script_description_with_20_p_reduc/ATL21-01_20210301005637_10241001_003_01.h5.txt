Here is the reduced text while keeping as many implementation details as possible:

The provided Python code imports necessary modules, sets up a file path and mode, reads data from an HDF5 file, handles missing values, creates a Basemap, plots the data, adds coastlines, parallels, and meridians, and saves the figure.

**Importing necessary modules**

The code imports `os`, `matplotlib.pyplot` as `plt`, `numpy` as `np`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap` as `Basemap`, and `h5py`.

**Setting up the file path and mode**

The code sets the file name and path to an HDF5 file and opens it in read-only mode using a `with` statement.

**Reading data from the HDF5 file**

The code reads several datasets from the HDF5 file: `latvar`, `lonvar`, and `dset_name`. It reads the entire datasets into memory using slicing and retrieves attributes from the `datavar` dataset.

**Handling FillValue**

The code replaces values equal to `_FillValue` with NaN and creates a masked array using `np.ma.masked_where`.

**Creating a Basemap and plotting the data**

The code creates a Basemap object with an NPST projection and plots the data using `m.pcolormesh`. It adds coastlines, parallels, and meridians to the plot.

**Adding a colorbar and title**

The code adds a colorbar to the plot using `m.colorbar` and sets its label to the units of the data. It also sets the title of the plot using the file name and long name of the dataset.

**Saving the figure**

Finally, the code saves the figure to a PNG file using `fig.savefig`.
