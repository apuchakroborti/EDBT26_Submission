Here is the reduced description, keeping as many implementation details as possible:

**Step 1: Importing necessary libraries**

The code imports several Python libraries:
* `os`
* `matplotlib.pyplot` as `plt`
* `numpy` as `np`
* `mpl_toolkits.basemap` as `Basemap`
* `h5py`

**Step 2: Defining the file name and opening the HDF5 file**

The code defines a variable `FILE_NAME` with the path to an HDF5 file. It then opens the file in read-only mode (`mode="r"`) using `h5py.File()`.

**Step 3: Reading datasets from the HDF5 file**

The code reads three datasets:
* `/mid_latitude/latitude`
* `/mid_latitude/longitude`
* `/mid_latitude/beam_1/dot_avg`

It also retrieves attributes from the `datavar` dataset:
* `units`
* `long_name`
* `_FillValue`

**Step 4: Handling FillValue and creating a masked array**

The code replaces all occurrences of `_FillValue` with `np.nan` using NumPy's broadcasting rules. It then creates a masked array using `np.ma.masked_where()`.

**Step 5-7: Creating a map projection, drawing coastlines, and creating a pcolormesh plot**

The code uses `Basemap` to create an equidistant cylindrical projection with a low-resolution coastline database. It draws coastlines on the map and creates a pseudocolor mesh plot using `m.pcolormesh()`.

**Step 8-9: Creating a colorbar, setting the plot title, and saving the figure**

The code creates a colorbar using `m.colorbar()`, sets the plot title using `plt.title()`, and saves the figure to a PNG file using `fig.savefig()`.

Note that I removed some redundant information and condensed the steps 5-7 to focus on the main implementation details.
