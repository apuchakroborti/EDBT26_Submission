Here is the reduced text while keeping as many implementation details as possible:

Let's break down this Python code step by step:

**Importing Libraries**

The code imports several libraries: `os`, `matplotlib.pyplot` as `plt`, `numpy` as `np`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap` as `Basemap`, and `h5py`.

**Defining the HDF5 File**

The code defines the path to an HDF5 file using the `FILE_NAME` variable.

**Opening the HDF5 File**

The code opens the HDF5 file using `h5py` with read-only mode.

**Accessing Datasets in the HDF5 File**

The code accesses several datasets within the HDF5 file:

1. **Latitude**: The code reads the "latitude" dataset into a NumPy array and extracts its valid minimum and maximum values.
2. **Longitude**: Similar to latitude, but for longitude.
3. **Height (dem_h)**: The code reads the "dem_h" dataset into a NumPy array and extracts its units and long name.

**Visualizing the Data**

The code uses `Basemap` to create a map visualization with an equidistant cylindrical projection. It adds coastlines, parallels, and meridians to the map, as well as a scatter plot of height values with a colorbar.

**Saving the Plot**

Finally, the code saves the plot to a PNG file using `matplotlib`.

That's it!
