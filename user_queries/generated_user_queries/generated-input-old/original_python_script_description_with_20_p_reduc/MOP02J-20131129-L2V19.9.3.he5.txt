Here is the reduced text, keeping as many implementation details as possible:

**Comments and Importing Libraries**

The script starts with comments explaining its purpose, usage, and contact information. It then imports several libraries: `os`, `h5py`, `matplotlib` and `matplotlib.pyplot`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, and `numpy`.

**Setting File Paths and Names**

Two variables are set: `FILE_PATH` (the directory containing the HDF file) and `FILE_NAME` (the full path to the HDF file).

**Opening and Reading the HDF File**

The script opens the HDF file in read-only mode using `h5py.File()` with a `with` statement to ensure proper closure. Within the block, it:

* Retrieves the `/HDFEOS/SWATHS/MOP02/Data Fields/RetrievedSurfaceTemperature` dataset.
* Extracts data values and attributes (units and fill value).
* Replaces fill values with NaN.

**Retrieving Geolocation Data**

The script retrieves two datasets: `/HDFEOS/SWATHS/MOP02/Geolocation Fields/Latitude` and `/HDFEOS/SWATHS/MOP02/Geolocation Fields/Longitude`.

**Creating a Map and Plotting the Data**

A Basemap object `m` is created with a cylindrical projection and resolution 'l'. The script:

* Draws coastlines, parallels, and meridians on the map.
* Creates a scatter plot of the data using `m.scatter()` with longitude and latitude coordinates.

**Adding a Colorbar and Title**

The script creates a colorbar, sets its label to the units of the data, and sets the title of the plot using `plt.title()`.

**Saving the Plot to a File**

Finally, the script saves the plot to a PNG file using `fig.savefig()`.
