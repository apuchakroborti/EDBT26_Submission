Here is the reduced text, keeping as many implementation details as possible:

**Comments and Docstrings**

The code starts with comments and docstrings providing information about the script, its purpose, and how to use it.

**Importing Modules**

The code imports several modules: `os`, `matplotlib.pyplot` as `plt`, `numpy` as `np`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap` as `Basemap`, and `h5py`.

**Defining Constants**

The code defines a constant `FILE_NAME` for the HDF5 file to be read.

**Reading the HDF5 File**

The code opens the HDF5 file using `h5py` in read-only mode:
```python
with h5py.File(FILE_NAME, mode="r") as f:
    ...
```
**Reading Datasets and Attributes**

The code reads three datasets: `/gt1l/segment_lat`, `/gt1l/segment_lon`, and `/gt1l/segment_geoid`. It also extracts attributes `units`, `long_name`, and `_FillValue` from the last dataset.

**Handling Fill Values**

The code replaces fill values with NaN values:
```python
data[data == _FillValue] = np.nan
```
**Creating a Map**

The code creates an equidistant cylindrical projection map using `Basemap`:
```python
m = Basemap(
    projection="cyl",
    resolution="l",
    llcrnrlat=-90,
    urcrnrlat=90,
    llcrnrlon=-180,
    urcrnrlon=180,
)
```
**Drawing the Map and Scattering Data Points**

The code draws coastlines, parallels, and meridians on the map. It also scatters data points using `m.scatter`.

**Creating a Colorbar and Setting Labels**

The code creates a colorbar at the bottom of the map and sets its label using the `units` attribute.

**Setting the Plot Title and Saving the Plot**

The code sets the plot title using file and dataset names, and saves the plot to a PNG file.
