Here is the rewritten description, reduced by 20% while keeping as many implementation details as possible:

Let's break down this Python code step-by-step:

**Comments and documentation**

The code starts with comments providing information about the script, its purpose, and how to use it.

**Importing modules**

The next few lines import various Python modules: `os` for interacting with the operating system, `h5py` for reading and writing HDF5 files, `numpy as np` for numerical computing, and `matplotlib` with aliases `mpl` and `plt` for creating plots and visualizations.

**Defining file paths and names**

The code defines the file path and name: `FILE_PATH` sets the directory path, and `FILE_NAME` concatenates it with the actual file name.

**Reading the HDF5 file**

The code opens the HDF5 file using `h5py` in read-only mode (`mode='r'`) and assigns it to a variable `f`. The `with` statement ensures proper file closure.

**Accessing datasets**

Inside the `with` block, the code accesses datasets within the HDF5 file. It sets the path to a specific dataset, reads the data, and extracts attributes like units and fill value.

**Replacing fill values with NaN**

The code replaces fill values in the data with NaN values using NumPy: `data[data == fillvalue] = np.nan`.

Note that I removed some of the redundant explanations and condensed similar information into shorter sentences. I also kept the implementation details, such as the specific module imports, file path definitions, and HDF5 dataset access.
