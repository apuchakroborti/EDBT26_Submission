Here's the reduced text while keeping as many implementation details as possible:

**Importing Libraries**

The code starts by importing several libraries:
```python
import os
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from mpl_toolkits.basemap import Basemap
import numpy as np
import h5py
```
These libraries are used for various tasks such as operating system-related functions, plotting and visualization, creating maps, numerical computations, and reading and writing HDF5 files.

**Defining Constants**

The code defines two constants:
```python
FILE_NAME ='DeepBlue-SeaWiFS-1.0_L3_20100101_v004-20130604T131317Z.h5'
DATAFIELD_NAME = 'aerosol_optical_thickness_550_ocean'
```
`FILE_NAME` is the name of the HDF5 file to be read, and `DATAFIELD_NAME` is the name of a specific dataset within that file.

**Reading HDF5 File**

The code uses the `h5py` library to read the HDF5 file:
```python
with h5py.File(FILE_NAME, mode='r') as f:
    data = f[DATAFIELD_NAME][:]
    latitude = f['latitude'][:]
    longitude = f['longitude'][:]
```
This opens the file in read-only mode and assigns it to a variable `f`. The `with` statement ensures that the file is properly closed when we're done with it.

**Data Processing**

The code performs some basic data processing:
```python
_FillValue = f[DATAFIELD_NAME].attrs['_FillValue']
data[data == _FillValue] = np.nan
data = np.ma.masked_array(data, np.isnan(data))
```
This code replaces any values in `data` that match `_FillValue` with `NaN` and creates a masked array from `data`, where `NaN` values are treated as missing data.

**Map Visualization**

The code uses the `Basemap` library to create a map visualization:
```python
m = Basemap(projection='cyl', resolution='l',
            llcrnrlat=-90, urcrnrlat=90,
            llcrnrlon=-180, urcrnrlon=180)
m.drawcoastlines(linewidth=0.5)
m.pcolormesh(longitude, latitude, data, vmin=0, vmax=1, latlon=True)
m.colorbar()
```
This code creates a `Basemap` object with an equidistant cylindrical projection and sets the map boundaries using latitude and longitude ranges.

**Plotting**

The code sets up a plot title and saves the figure to a PNG file:
```python
basename = os.path.basename(FILE_NAME)
plt.title('{0}\n{1}'.format(basename, long_name))
fig.savefig("{0}.py.png".format(basename))
```
This code gets the base name of the HDF5 file using `os.path.basename`, sets a plot title that includes the file name and dataset long name, and saves the figure to a PNG file with a name based on the HDF5 file name.
