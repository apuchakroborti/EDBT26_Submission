Here is the reduced text, keeping as many implementation details as possible:

**Importing Modules**

The code imports various modules: `datetime`, `os`, `matplotlib` and its sub-module `pyplot`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, and `numpy`.

**Defining Constants**

A constant `USE_NETCDF4` determines whether to use the NetCDF4 library or h5py to read the HDF-EOS file.

**Defining the `run` Function**

The `run` function takes a single argument, `FILE_NAME`, which is the path to an HDF-EOS file. It reads the file using either NetCDF4 or h5py, depending on `USE_NETCDF4`. The function retrieves the 'SST' dataset within the 'NCEP' group and extracts its data, long name, and units.

**Data Processing**

The code processes the retrieved data by creating latitude and longitude arrays based on the shape of the data. If using h5py, it applies the fill value to replace missing values with NaN.

**Visualization**

The code uses Basemap and Matplotlib to create a visualization: it creates a Basemap object, draws coastlines, parallels, and meridians, plots the SST data using `pcolormesh`, and adds a colorbar with a label indicating the units of the data.

**Save Plot to File**

The code saves the plot to a PNG file by extracting the basename from the input file path, creating a filename for the PNG file, and saving the figure to the created file.

**Main Script**

The main script sets the input file name, checks an environment variable `HDFEOS_ZOO_DIR` to construct the full path to the input file, and calls the `run` function with the input file name as an argument.

In summary, this code reads an HDF-EOS file, extracts SST data, processes it, and visualizes it using Basemap and Matplotlib, saving the plot to a PNG file.
