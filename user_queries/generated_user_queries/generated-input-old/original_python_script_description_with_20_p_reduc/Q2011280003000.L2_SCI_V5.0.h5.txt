Here is the reduced description while keeping as many implementation details as possible:

**Importing Modules**

The code imports various Python modules: `os`, `h5py`, `matplotlib` and its sub-module `pyplot`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, and `numpy`.

**Setting File Paths and Names**

The code sets two variables: `FILE_PATH` (the directory containing the HDF5 file) and `FILE_NAME` (the full path to the HDF5 file).

**Opening the HDF5 File and Accessing Datasets**

The code opens the HDF5 file in read-only mode using `h5py.File` and assigns it to a variable `f`. It then accesses various datasets and attributes: `datavar`, `data`, `units`, `long_name`, `fv`, `latitude`, and `longitude`.

**Handling Fill Values and Creating a Basemap**

The code replaces fill values with NaN using NumPy's `nan` constant, creates a masked array (`datam`) to handle missing values, and creates a Basemap object (`m`) with cylindrical projection, low resolution, and specific latitude and longitude limits.

**Plotting Data and Adding Map Features**

The code plots the data using `m.scatter`, adds coastlines, parallels, and meridians to the Basemap, and creates a colorbar (`cb`) with a label set to the units attribute.

**Setting Plot Title and Saving Figure**

The code sets the plot title using the file name and long name attributes and saves the figure as a PNG file with a constructed name.
