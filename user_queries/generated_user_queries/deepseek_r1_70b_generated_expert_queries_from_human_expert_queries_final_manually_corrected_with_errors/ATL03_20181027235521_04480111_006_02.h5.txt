1. Define Constants:  
   Set the constant `FILE_NAME` to the path of the HDF5 file: "ATL03_20181027235521_04480111_006_02.h5".

2. Open HDF5 File and Access Datasets:  
   Open the HDF5 file in read mode and access these datasets:
   - `reference_photon_lat` as latitude data and `reference_photon_lon` as longitude data from the `/gt1l/geolocation`
   - `/gt1l/geolocation/tx_pulse_energy` for the main data.

3. Extract Dataset Attributes:  
   For the tx_pulse_energy dataset, read the `units` and `long name` attributes using `.decode('ascii', 'replace')`. 
   Also, retrieve the `fillValue` attribute from the main dataset.

4. Create Map Projection:  
   Use an equidistant cylindrical projection with low resolution. Set the latitude range from -90 to 90 and longitude range from -180 to 180.

5. Customize Map Features:  
   Add coastlines with a line width of 0.5. Draw parallels at intervals of 30 degree from -90 to 120 
   and meridians at intervals of 45 degree from -180 to 180

6. Plot Data on the Map:  
   Use the `scatter` function with longitude as x, latitude as y, data for color (c parameter), marker size of 0.1, colormap 'jet', no edge colors, and zero linewidth.

7. Add Colorbar and Title:  
   Append a colorbar with format '%.2e' labeled using the main dataset's units. Set the plot title to include the HDF5 file's basename and the `long name` attribute of the main dataset.
