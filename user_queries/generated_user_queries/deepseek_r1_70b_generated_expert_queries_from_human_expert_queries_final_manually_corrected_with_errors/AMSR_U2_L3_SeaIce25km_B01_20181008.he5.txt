A Python script that processes and visualizes data from an HDF-EOS5 file by following these steps:

1. Define constants for the main dataset path 'SI_25km_NH_89V_DAY' located at /HDFEOS/GRIDS/NpPolarGrid25km/Data Fields 
and grid metadata path ('/HDFEOS INFORMATION/StructMetadata.0').

2. Create a function that takes a file name as input, opens the HDF-EOS5 file, extracts metadata, and retrieves projection parameters.

3. Convert the main dataset to numpy.float64 using astype.

4. Preprocess the data by:
   - Setting values equal to 0 to NaN.
   - Scaling the data by multiplying with 0.1.
   - Creating a masked array using numpy.ma.masked_array where data is invalid.

5. Construct the grid using extracted projection parameters and data shape, then transform coordinates from EASE Grid to WGS84 using pyproj.

6. Create a map using Basemap with:
   - npstere projection.
   - Low resolution.
   - boundinglat=33 and lon_0=0.
   - Coastlines with linewidth 0.5.
   - Parallels at latitudes from 0 to 90 with every 20 degree with left labels only
   - Meridians at longitudes from -180 to 180 to every 45 degree with bottom labels.

7. Add a pcolormesh layer using longitude, latitude, and data with latlon=True.

8. Include a colorbar labeled with the main dataset's units.

9. Set the plot title to include the file basename and the main dataset's long_name containing 'SI_25km_NH_89V_DAY'.
