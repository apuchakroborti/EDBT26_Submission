A Python script that performs the following tasks:

1. Open an HE5 file named "MLS-Aura_L2GP-O3_v04-23-c02_2019d001.he5" in read mode.

2. Access the following datasets within the file:
   - Ozone data: "/HDFEOS/SWATHS/O3/Data Fields/L2gpValue"
   - Latitude values: "Latitude", Pressure levels: "Pressure", Time information: "Time" from the group `/HDFEOS/SWATHS/O3/Geolocation Fields`

3. Read ozone data from index 0 to 70 along the x-axis and all y-axis data.
4. Read latitude data from index 0 to 70.
5. Read pressure data up to index 55.
6. Extract units and title information from the ozone, latitude, and longitude datasets and also and decods the value.

7. Preprocess the data:
   - Replace _FillValue with numpy NaN.
   - Mask ozone data using masked_array where values are NaN.

8. Calculate start and end times using datetime functions relative to "1993-01-01" plus time in seconds from index 0 and 70, respectively, and format these as strings.

9. Create a pcolormesh plot with parameters: latitude, longitude, and ozone data transposed (data.T).

10. Set x-axis label using latitude title and units, and y-axis label using longitude title and units.

11. Set the plot title to include the data title concatenated with start and end times.

12. Configure the plot:
    - sets gca to plt
    - Invert the y-axis.
    - Set y-scale to log.
    - Format major ticks to display values with one decimal place.

13. Save the plot at the location of the data file and Display the plot.
