A Python script to read an HDF-EOS5 file and plot BrO data against pressure levels with the following specifications:

1. Read HDF-EOS5 File: 
   - Extract BrO data from the group `/HDFEOS/SWATHS/BrO/Data Fields`.
   - Retrieve pressure data from `/Geolocation Fields/Pressure`.
   - Obtain time data from `/Geolocation Fields/Time`.

2. Data Extraction:
   - Slice BrO data to get the 399th index along the x-axis and all data along the y-axis.
   - Convert BrO and pressure data into 1D arrays for plotting.

3. Attributes Handling: Extract attributes like MissingValue, _FillValue, Title, and Units.

4. Plotting:
   - Use matplotlib to plot BrO data (indices 12-16) against corresponding pressure values.
   - Set the x-axis label using BrO's title and units.
   - Set the y-axis label using pressure units.
   - Title the plot with BrO's title and the file's basename.

5. Plot Configuration:
   - Invert the y-axis.
   - Apply a logarithmic scale to the y-axis.
   - Use ScalarFormatter for minor ticks and FormatStrFormatter for major ticks.
   - At the end, the gca is set with invert_yaxis, yscale value of log, minor formatter is ScalarFormatter, and major formatter is FormatStrFormatter
