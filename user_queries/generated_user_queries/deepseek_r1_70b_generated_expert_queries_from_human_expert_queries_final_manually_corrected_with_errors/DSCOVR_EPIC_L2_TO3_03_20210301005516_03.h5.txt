A Python script that accesses and visualizes ozone data from a NASA HDF-EOS file named `DSCOVR_EPIC_L2_TO3_03_20210301005516_03.h5`. 
The script should perform the following steps:

1. Open the HDF5 file in read-only mode and extract the following datasets:
   - `/Ozone` for ozone data
   - `/Latitude` for latitude coordinates
   - `/Longitude` for longitude coordinates

2. Set attributes such as `units` (expected value: 'DU') and `long_name` (expected value: 'Ozone').

3. Process the ozone data by replacing the static fill value (-999.0) with NaN values using numpy's masked_where function, based on whether the ozone data is not a number.

4. Calculate the midpoint of the latitude and longitude arrays to determine the center point for visualization.

5. Create an orthographic projection map centered at the calculated midpoint using Cartopy's Orthographic class.

6. Plot the ozone data as a scatter plot with parameters:
   - Longitude as x-coordinates
   - Latitude as y-coordinates
   - Ozone values represented by color (using cmap=plt.cm.jet)
   - Marker size of 1
   - Data transformation set to PlateCarree coordinates

7. Add map features including gridlines, coastlines, and degree labels for latitude and longitude.

8. Create a colorbar with a width of 0.022 and padding of 0.01.
