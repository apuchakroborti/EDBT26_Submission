A Python script that reads ozone data from an HDF5 file and generates a visualization.

1. Read HDF5 File: Open the specified HDF5 file using h5py to access its contents.

2. Extract Datasets:
   - Retrieve the 3D ProfileOzone data from `ProfileOzone`.
   - Extract Latitude data from `Latitude`.
   - Obtain ProfilePressureLevels from `ProfilePressureLevels`.
   - Fetch Date data from `Date`.
   All from the group `Data_Fields`
   
3. Extract Attributes: From the ProfileOzone, Latitude, and ProfilePressureLevels datasets, extract the 'Units' and 'long name' attributes for labeling purposes.

4. Data Processing:
   - Slice ProfileOzone to get the 0th index along the x-axis (ProfileOzone[0, :, :]).
   - Extract the 0th index from Date data.
   - Replace _FillValue in ProfileOzone with NaN using numpy's masked_where function.

5. Transform Pressure Levels: Apply log10 transformation to ProfilePressureLevels.

6. Create Visualization:
   - Use contourf to plot latitude vs. transformed pressure levels with ozone data.
   - Add a colorbar labeled with ozone units.
   - Set x-axis label to Latitude's long name and units.
   - Set y-axis label to a combination of Pressure Levels' long name and units.
   - Set the title to include the HDF5 filename and ProfileOzone's long name.

7. Display Plot: Render the plot using matplotlib's show function.
