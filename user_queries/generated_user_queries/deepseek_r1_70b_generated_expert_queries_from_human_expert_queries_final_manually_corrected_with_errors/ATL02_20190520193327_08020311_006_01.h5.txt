A Python script that processes an HDF5 file and generates a split-window plot with specific visualizations.

1. Define Constants: Set `FILE_NAME` to "ATL12_20190330212241_00250301_006_03.h5".

2. Open HDF5 File: Read the file in read mode and access these datasets:
   - `latitude`, `longitude` both from /gpsr/navigation
   - `bg_cnt_50shot_s` and `delta_time` (time data) both from the sub-group path `/atlas/pce1/background`

3. Extract Attributes: For the bg_cnt_50shot_s dataset, read 'unit' and 'long name' attributes using decode('ascii', 'replace').

4. Create Plots:
   - First Plot (Time vs. Counts): 
     - Set figure size to 10x10.
     - Use subplot ax1 at position 2,1,1.
     - Calculate elapsed_time by subtracting the first time value from each time point.
     - Plot elapsed_time vs. main data with blue circles.
     - Label axes with time units and main data units.
     - Set title combining the file name, dataset name, and long name.

   - Second Plot (Trajectory Map):
     - Calculate midpoint latitude (lat_m) and longitude (lon_m).
     - Use cartopy's orthographic projection centered at lat_m and lon_m.
     - Enable gridlines with labels and degrees, minutes, seconds (dms).
     - Display global features and coastlines.
     - Plot trajectory in blue, using Geodetic transformation.
     - Mark the starting point with a red circle and label "START" offset by 200 km.

5. Adjust Layout: Use tight layout with padding of 3.0 for proper spacing.
