A Python code to read and visualize data from an HDF-EOS5 file located at HIRDLS-Aura_L2_v07-00-20-c01_2008d077.he5.

The code should:
1. Read three datasets:
   - O3 data from `O3` (extract 0th index along x-axis and all y-axis data) from the group `/HDFEOS/SWATHS/HIRDLS/Data Fields`
   - Pressure data from `Pressure`, Time data from `Time` (only 0th index) from the group `/HDFEOS/SWATHS/HIRDLS/Geolocation Fields`

2. Read attributes:
   - units from O3 and Pressure datasets
   - title from O3, Time, and Pressure datasets
   - fillValue from O3 dataset

3. Decode attribute values using decode().

4. Replace O3 data with NaN where it matches _FillValue.

5. Create datestr variable by initializing a datetime object at 1993-01-01 and adding seconds from the Time dataset.

6. Generate a plot of O3 vs Pressure:
   - Customize x-axis with scientific notation
   - Set y-axis to log scale and invert it
   - Format axis labels using dataset Titles and Units
   - Set title combining filename, O3 Title, and Units

7. At the end, the gca of the plot is set such as invert yaxis, yscale value of log, and major formatter is FormatStrFormatter with the value of '%g'. Display the plot.
