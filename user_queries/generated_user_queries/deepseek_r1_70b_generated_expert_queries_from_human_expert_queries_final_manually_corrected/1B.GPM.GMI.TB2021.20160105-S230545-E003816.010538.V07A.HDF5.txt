Create a Python script that performs the following steps:

1. Import necessary libraries: os, matplotlib, matplotlib.pyplot, numpy, mpl_toolkits.basemap, and h5py.

2. Open an HDF5 file in read mode using h5py and extract the dataset located at '/S1/Tb', 
including its 'units' and '_FillValue' attributes. Also, retrieve geolocation data from '/S1/Latitude' and '/S1/Longitude'.

3. Mask NaN values in the '/S1/Tb' dataset using numpy's masked_where function with parameters based on numpy's isnan.

4. Create a cylindrical projection map with specific settings (low resolution, -90 to 90 latitude range, -180 to 180 longitude range etc.). 
it also adds coastlines with width 0.5, parrallels with the numpy arrange of values -90, 91, and 45.
After that it also add meridians with the first parameter using numpy of arrange -180, 180, and 45 and labels are list of [True, False, False, True] 

5. Plot the dataset as a scatter plot on the map using the 'jet' colormap, setting each point's size to 1.

6. Add a colorbar below the plot with padding of 10% and label it using the units extracted from the '/S1/Tb' dataset.

7. Set the plot title by combining the HDF5 file's basename, the string "/S1/Tb", and "(nchan1=0)".
