A Python code to read and visualize data from an HDF-EOS5 file located at HIRDLS-Aura_L2_v07-00-20-c01_2008d077.he5.

The code should:
1. Import necessary libraries: os, datetime, h5py, numpy as np, FormatStrFormatter and ScalarFormatter from matplotlib.ticker, matplotlib as mpl, matplotlib.pyplot as plt, and Basemap from mpl_toolkits.basemap.

2. Read three datasets:
   - O3 data from /HDFEOS/SWATHS/HIRDLS/Data Fields/O3 (extract 0th index along x-axis and all y-axis data)
   - Pressure data from /HDFEOS/SWATHS/HIRDLS/Geolocation Fields/Pressure
   - Time data from /HDFEOS/SWATHS/HIRDLS/Geolocation Fields/Time (only 0th index)

3. Read attributes:
   - Units from O3 and Pressure datasets
   - Title from O3, Time, and Pressure datasets
   - _FillValue from O3 dataset

4. Decode attribute values using decode().

5. Replace O3 data with NaN where it matches _FillValue.

6. Create datestr variable by initializing a datetime object at 1993-01-01 and adding seconds from the Time dataset.

7. Generate a plot of O3 vs Pressure:
   - Customize x-axis with scientific notation
   - Set y-axis to log scale and invert it
   - Format axis labels using dataset Titles and Units
   - Set title combining filename, O3 Title, and Units

8. At the end, the gca of the plot is set such as invert yaxis, yscale value of log, and major formatter is FormatStrFormatter with the value of '%g'. Display the plot.
