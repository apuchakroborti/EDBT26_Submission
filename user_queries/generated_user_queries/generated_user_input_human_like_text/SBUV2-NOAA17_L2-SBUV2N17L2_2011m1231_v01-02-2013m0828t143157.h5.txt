Here is the rewritten description:

Can you explain this Python code? It reads an HDF5 file, extracts datasets and attributes, processes the data, and creates a contour plot. 

The code starts by importing necessary libraries: `os`, `h5py`, `datetime`, `numpy` (as `np`), `matplotlib` (as `mpl` and `plt`), and `FormatStrFormatter`. It then defines a constant `FILE_NAME` with the name of an HDF5 file.

The code opens the HDF5 file in read mode using `h5py.File` and accesses various datasets: `/SCIENCE_DATA/ProfileO3Retrieved`, `/GEOLOCATION_DATA/Latitude`, `/ANCILLARY_DATA/PressureLevels`, and `/nTimes`. It also reads attributes from each dataset, such as units, valid ranges, and long names.

The code then reads the data from each dataset, applies transformations (replacing invalid values with NaN, etc.), and creates a masked array. It sorts the latitude data in ascending order and converts time data to datetime objects.

Finally, it creates a contour plot using `plt.contourf` with customized axis labels, title, and annotations. The plot is then saved to a PNG file with the same name as the HDF5 file but with a `.py.png` extension.
