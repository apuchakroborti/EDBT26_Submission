Here is a rewritten version of the description, condensed by 40% while keeping implementation details:

**Breaking down this Python code**

The code starts by importing necessary modules: `os`, `matplotlib.pyplot` (aliased as `plt`), `numpy` (aliased as `np`), `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, and `h5py`.

It then defines a constant, `FILE_NAME`, which is the name of the HDF5 file to be accessed.

The code uses `h5py` to access the HDF5 file in read-only mode and assigns it to the variable `f`. It reads several datasets from the file:

* `latvar`: latitude values at `/gt1l/ssh_segments/latitude`
* `lonvar`: longitude values at `/gt1l/ssh_segments/longitude`
* `datavar`: height values at `/gt1l/ssh_segments/heights/swh`

The code uses `matplotlib` and `mpl_toolkits.basemap` to visualize the data:

* Creates a Basemap object with an equidistant cylindrical projection
* Draws the coastline, parallels, and meridians
* Creates a scatter plot with longitude on the x-axis, latitude on the y-axis, and color representing height values
* Adds a colorbar with a label set to the units of the dataset

Finally, the code saves the plot as a PNG file by constructing the filename from the HDF5 file's basename and using `fig.savefig`.

This code accesses an HDF5 file containing ICESat-2 ATL12 L3A version 6 data, reads several datasets, and visualizes the data as a scatter plot with a colorbar.
