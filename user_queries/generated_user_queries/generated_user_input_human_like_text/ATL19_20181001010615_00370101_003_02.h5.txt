Here is a rewritten version of the description with 40% less text while keeping as many implementation details as possible:

**Python Code Explanation**

The code starts by importing necessary libraries, including `os`, `matplotlib.pyplot` (aliased as `plt`), `numpy` (aliased as `np`), `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, and `h5py`.

It defines a constant `FILE_NAME` for the HDF5 file to be read. The code then opens the specified HDF5 file in read-only mode using `h5py` and reads several datasets, including `/mid_latitude/latitude`, `/mid_latitude/longitude`, and `/mid_latitude/beam_1/dot_avg`. It also retrieves attributes like units, long name, and fill value.

The code replaces fill values with `NaN` using NumPy's masking capabilities. It creates a Basemap object with an equidistant cylindrical projection and sets the map boundaries to cover the entire globe.

The code draws coastlines, parallels, and meridians on the map, then plots the data using `m.pcolormesh()` with latitude and longitude coordinates. A colorbar is added with a label set to the units of the data.

Finally, the code sets the plot title to include the filename and long name of the dataset, and saves the plot as a PNG image file with a name derived from the input HDF5 file name.
