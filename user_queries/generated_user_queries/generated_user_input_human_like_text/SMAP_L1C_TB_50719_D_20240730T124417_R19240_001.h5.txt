Here's a rewritten version of the description, condensed by 40% while keeping essential implementation details:

"Can you explain this Python code step-by-step? 

It starts by importing necessary libraries: `os`, `matplotlib.pyplot` as `plt`, `numpy` as `np`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap` as `Basemap`, and `h5py`.

The code defines a constant `FILE_NAME` for the HDF5 file to be read, then opens it in read-only mode using `h5py`. 

Within the `with` block, it accesses and processes several datasets: 

* `cell_tb_h_fore` dataset, reading it into a NumPy array `data`.
* Extracts attributes like `units`, `long_name`, `_FillValue`, `valid_max`, and `valid_min`.
* Identifies invalid data points using logical operations and sets them to NaN.

It also accesses `cell_lat` and `cell_lon` datasets for geolocation data. 

Using `Basemap`, the code creates a map visualization with cylindrical projection, low resolution, coastlines, parallels, meridians, and a scatter plot of the data points. A colorbar is added with units labeling.

Finally, it saves the plot as a PNG file using `plt.gcf()` and `fig.savefig()`. The file name is constructed by appending `.py.png` to the base name of the HDF5 file."
