Here is the rewritten description:

"I'm trying to understand a Python script that reads an HDF5 file, extracts data, and creates a map visualization. Can you explain it step by step?

The code starts by importing necessary libraries: `os`, `matplotlib`, `Basemap`, `numpy`, and `h5py`.

It then defines two constants: the name of the HDF5 file to be read and assigns it to `FILE_NAME`.

Next, it reads the HDF5 file using `h5py` and accesses three datasets: `/lat`, `/lon`, and `/smap_spd`. It extracts metadata from the `/smap_spd` dataset, including units, long name, and fill value.

The script replaces fill values with NaN and creates a masked array. Then, it uses Basemap to create an equidistant cylindrical projection map, drawing coastlines, parallels, and meridians. The data points are scattered on the map using longitude and latitude values, colored according to their values.

Finally, it adds a colorbar and title to the plot, including the file name and long name of the data, and saves the plot to a PNG file."

I removed some details to reduce the text by 40%, but kept the main implementation details intact. I also rewrote the description to make it sound like a prompt from a real human user asking for help understanding the code.
