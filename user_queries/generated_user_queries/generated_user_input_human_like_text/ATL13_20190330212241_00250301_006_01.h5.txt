Here's a rewritten version of the description, condensed by 40% while preserving implementation details:

Can you explain this Python code step-by-step?

The code starts by importing necessary libraries: `os`, `matplotlib.pyplot` as `plt`, `numpy` as `np`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap` as `Basemap`, and `h5py`.

It then defines a constant `FILE_NAME` for the HDF5 file `"ATL13_20190330212241_00250301_006_01.h5"`.

The code opens the HDF5 file in read-only mode using `h5py` and accesses three datasets: `/gt1l/segment_lat`, `/gt1l/segment_lon`, and `/gt1l/segment_geoid`. It reads each dataset into memory using slicing and handles `_FillValue` by replacing it with `NaN` and creating a masked array.

The code creates an equidistant cylindrical projection using `Basemap` and draws coastlines, parallels, and meridians. It then plots the geoid data on the map projection using `m.scatter` with a jet-like color scheme.

A colorbar is added to the plot using `m.colorbar`, and the title is set using `plt.title`. Finally, the figure is saved to a PNG file using `fig.savefig`.

I'd appreciate it if you could break down each step of this code!
