Here is the reduced text:

Can you explain this Python code? 

It imports several modules: `os`, `re`, `h5py`, `numpy` (`np`), `matplotlib` (`mpl`) and `matplotlib.pyplot` (`plt`), and `Basemap`. 

Then it defines a constant for an HDF5 file name. The script reads the HDF5 file using `h5py`, extracts datasets `/lst`, `/lon`, and `/lat`, and applies scaling and fill values to the data. 

It uses `Basemap` to create a 2D map visualization, plotting the data as a scatter plot with colors determined by the data values. The script customizes the visualization by adding a colorbar, setting the title, and saving the figure as a PNG image.

Let me know if you have any questions about this code!
