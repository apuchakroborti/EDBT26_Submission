Here is a rewritten version of the description, condensed by 40% while keeping as many implementation details as possible:

Can you explain this Python code step-by-step?

The code starts by importing necessary modules: `os`, `h5py`, `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.basemap`, and `numpy`.

It defines two constants: `FILE_NAME` (the name of the HDF5 file to be read) and opens the file using `h5py` in read mode.

Within the `with` block, the code accesses several datasets and attributes from the HDF5 file:
paths are l3m_data, data_minimum, data_maximum, Sea Surface Salinity'
* `datavar`: a dataset containing the main data of interest
* `data`: extracts the first column of `datavar`
* `units`, `long_name`, and `fv`: retrieves attributes of `datavar`

The code replaces fill values with NaN, creates a masked array, and uses `Basemap` to create a cylindrical map projection with specific settings. It adds coastlines, parallels, and meridians to the map.

The code plots the data on the map using `scatter`, sets the colormap, and adds a colorbar with a label set to the units of the data. Finally, it saves the plot as a PNG file with a name constructed from the HDF5 file's base name.
