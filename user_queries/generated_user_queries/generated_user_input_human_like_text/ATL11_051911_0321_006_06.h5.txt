Here is a rewritten version of the description, condensed by 40% while keeping as many implementation details as possible:

"Can you explain how this Python code works? 

It starts by importing necessary libraries: `os`, `h5py`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `Basemap`. Then it defines two constants: `FILE_NAME` (the HDF5 file to read) and `_FillValue` (a special value for missing data).

The code opens the HDF5 file with `h5py` in read-only mode, accessing three datasets: `/pt1/latitude`, `/pt1/longitude`, and `/pt1/h_corr`. It reads each dataset into memory using slicing.

Next, it extracts metadata from the `/pt1/h_corr` dataset, including units, long name, and `_FillValue`. The code replaces `_FillValue` with `NaN` values and creates a masked array using `np.ma.masked_where`.

Using Basemap, the code creates an equidistant cylindrical projection of the data, drawing coastlines, parallels/meridians, and scattering longitude and latitude values onto the map. It adds a colorbar with units and sets a title including the file name, dataset name, and long description.

Finally, it saves the visualization to a PNG file using Matplotlib's `savefig` method."

Let me know if you'd like me to make any further adjustments!
