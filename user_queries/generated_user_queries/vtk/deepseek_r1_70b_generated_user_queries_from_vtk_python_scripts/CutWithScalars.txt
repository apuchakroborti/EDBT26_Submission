1. Import Libraries: The script begins by importing necessary modules from `vtkmodules`. These include:
   - `vtkInteractionStyle` and `vtkRenderingOpenGL2` (though not directly used)
   - `vtkNamedColors` for color definitions
   - `vtkDoubleArray` for data storage
   - `vtkPlane` to define cutting planes
   - `vtkContourFilter` to generate contour lines
   - `vtkXMLPolyDataReader` to read input data
   - Rendering components like `vtkActor`, `vtkPolyDataMapper`, `vtkRenderWindow`, etc.

2. Define Input Parameters: 
   - Set `inputFilename` to `'CutWithScalars_Torso.vtp'`
   - Set `numberOfCuts` to 20

3. Initialize Color Palette: Create a `colors` object using `vtkNamedColors()` for consistent color schemes.

4. Read Input Data:
   - Use `vtkXMLPolyDataReader()` to read the input file.
   - Update the reader to process the data and retrieve the model's bounds, which are then printed.

5. Define Cutting Plane: 
   - Create a `vtkPlane` object named `plane`.
   - Set the plane's origin to the center of the model using the bounds.
   - Orient the plane perpendicular to the z-axis by setting its normal vector to (0, 0, 1).

6. Compute Scalar Values:
   - Initialize a `scalars` array of type `vtkDoubleArray`.
   - Populate this array by evaluating each point against the cutting plane.
   - Assign these scalars to the model's point data.

7. Generate Contours:
   - Create a contour filter (`cutter`) using `vtkContourFilter`.
   - Set the input to the reader's output, disable scalar and normal computations.
   - Generate 20 evenly spaced contours between 99% of the scalar range.

8. Create Cutter Actor:
   - Use `vtkPolyDataMapper` to map the cutter's output.
   - Create an actor (`cutterActor`) with yellow color (Banana) and line width set to 2.

9. Create Model Actor:
   - Set up another mapper for the original model data.
   - Create an actor (`modelActor`) with a flesh-like color (Flesh).

10. Set Up Rendering Environment:
    - Create a `vtkRenderer` instance, adding both actors to it.
    - Define a render window of size 600x600 named 'CutWithCutScalars' and add the renderer.

11. Configure Interaction and Camera:
    - Attach an interactor to the render window.
    - Set background color to Burlywood.
    - Position camera at (0, -1, 0), facing the origin with view up along z-axis.
    - Adjust camera angles: 30 degrees azimuth and elevation.

12. Render and Display:
    - Reset camera to fit the model.
    - Render the scene and start the interactor to display the window.

This structured approach ensures that each component is set up correctly, from data reading to visualization, providing a clear visual of contour lines on the model.
