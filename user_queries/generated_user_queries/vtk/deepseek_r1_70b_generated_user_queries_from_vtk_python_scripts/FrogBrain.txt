### Step-by-Step Description of the Python Script

#### 1. Import Required Libraries
The script begins by importing necessary libraries:
- `pathlib.Path` for file path handling.
- Various VTK modules for 3D rendering, image processing, and visualization.

#### 2. Main Function Setup
The `main` function is defined to accept two parameters: `data_folder` (path to data) and `tissue` (specific tissue to visualize).

#### 3. VTK Version Check
It checks if the installed VTK version is 8.2 or higher using `vtk_version_ok`.

#### 4. Color Setup
Utilizes `vtkNamedColors` for predefined color schemes.

#### 5. File Path Validation
Verifies that `data_folder` exists and contains the required file `frogtissue.mhd`. If not, it displays an error message.

#### 6. Tissue Mapping and Lookup Table Creation
- Creates a mapping of tissue names to numerical IDs using `create_tissue_map`.
- Generates a color lookup table (`lut`) with specific colors for each tissue type via `create_frog_lut`.

#### 7. Renderer and Window Setup
Configures the rendering environment:
- Two renderers (`renderer_left` and `renderer_right`) are created, each occupying half of the viewport.
- A render window of size 640x480 is set up with both renderers and an interactor for user interaction.

#### 8. Actor Creation
Two actors are created:
- Left Actor: Uses `create_frog_actor` to generate a non-smoothed model, added to the left renderer.
- Right Actor: Uses `create_smooth_frog_actor` to generate a smoothed model, added to the right renderer. This actor has additional properties for visual enhancement.

#### 9. Camera and View Configuration
Adjusts camera settings:
- The left renderer's camera is positioned to view the model from a specific angle.
- Both renderers have their backgrounds set to 'LightSteelBlue'.

#### 10. Rendering
The render window is displayed with the title "FrogBrain" and starts the interaction loop.

### Helper Functions

1. create_smooth_frog_actor
   - Reads the medical image file.
   - Applies thresholding, Gaussian smoothing, surface extraction, and additional smoothing to create a visually smooth actor.

2. create_frog_actor
   - Similar to the above but without smoothing, using either FlyingEdges3D or MarchingCubes for surface extraction.

3. create_frog_lut
   - Defines a color palette for different tissues using VTK's named colors.

4. create_tissue_map
   - Maps tissue names (e.g., 'blood', 'brain') to numerical IDs for lookup purposes.

5. vtk_version_ok
   - Checks if the current VTK version meets or exceeds a specified version, handling both old and new VTK versioning schemes.

### Execution
When run, the script defaults to visualizing the 'brain' tissue from the file `FrogBrain_frogtissue.mhd`, displaying both smoothed and unsmoothed models side by side.
