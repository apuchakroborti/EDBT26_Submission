### Step-by-Step Description of the Python Script

#### 1. Import Required Libraries
The script begins by importing specific modules from `vtkmodules`:
- `vtkNamedColors` from `vtkCommonColor`
- `vtkDecimatePro` and `vtkPolyDataNormals` from `vtkFiltersCore`
- `vtkPolyDataReader` from `vtkIOLegacy`
- Rendering components: `vtkActor`, `vtkCamera`, `vtkPolyDataMapper`, `vtkRenderWindow`, `vtkRenderWindowInteractor`, and `vtkRenderer` from `vtkRenderingCore`

#### 2. Define the Main Function
The main function initializes:
- A `vtkNamedColors` object named `colors` for color management.
- A file path variable `fileName` set to `'DecimateHawaii_honolulu.vtk'`.

#### 3. Read Input Data
A `vtkPolyDataReader` named `hawaii` is created and configured to read from the specified file.

#### 4. Decimation Process
An instance of `vtkDecimatePro` named `deci` is set up:
- Input is connected to the reader's output.
- Target reduction is set to 90% to reduce the polygon count significantly.
- Topology preservation is enabled to prevent mesh cracks.

#### 5. Compute Normals for Decimated Data
A `vtkPolyDataNormals` object named `decimatedNormals` processes the decimated data:
- Input is connected to the decimation output.
- Normals are flipped, and a feature angle of 60 degrees is set for smoothing.

#### 6. Create Mappers
Two mappers are created:
- `originalMapper` uses the original data from the reader (`hawaii.GetOutputPort()`).
- `decimatedMapper` uses the normals from the decimated data (`decimatedNormals.GetOutputPort()`).

#### 7. Set Up Actors
Actors are configured:
- `decimatedActor` is set to wireframe representation with color 'Sienna'.
- `originalActor` uses solid representation with the same color.

#### 8. Configure Rendering
Two renderers are created:
- `renderer1` (left viewport) and `renderer2` (right viewport).
- Both added to a `renderWindow` of size 800x400 pixels, titled 'DecimateHawaii'.

#### 9. Add Actors to Renderers
- `originalActor` is added to `renderer1`.
- `decimatedActor` is added to `renderer2`.

#### 10. Set Background Colors and Cameras
- `renderer1` background set to 'Wheat'.
- `renderer2` background set to 'Papaya_Whip'.
- A shared camera is configured with elevation and dolly settings for both renderers.

#### 11. Render and Interact
The render window is rendered, and the interactor starts to handle user interactions.

This structured approach ensures the script can be accurately reproduced, displaying original and decimated meshes side by side.
