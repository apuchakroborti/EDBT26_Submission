What This Script Does
This script takes a 3D image (like a CT scan) of a person's head and creates two separate surfaces: one for the skin and one for the bones. Then it displays these surfaces on your screen so you can see them.

Step-by-Step Explanation

1. Setting Up Colors
First, the script sets up some colors that will be used later to make different parts of the image look distinct:
- Skin color (a light brown)
- Background color (a dark blue)

2. Creating a Window for Display
Next, it creates a window where everything will be displayed. This is like setting up a TV screen where you'll watch the final result.

3. Reading the Image File
The script reads in the 3D image file of the head named `MedicalDemo2_FullHead.mhd`. Think of this as loading a photo into your computer.

4. Extracting the Skin Surface
Now, it looks for specific values within the image that represent the skin:
- It finds all points in the image where the value is 500 (which corresponds to skin).
- Then it creates a smooth surface from these points.
- This surface is then colored with the skin color.

5. Extracting the Bone Surface
Similarly, it looks for values that represent bones:
- It finds all points where the value is 1150 (which corresponds to bone).
- Creates another smooth surface from these points.
- Colors this surface a different color to distinguish it from the skin.

6. Adding an Outline
To give context and make things clearer, it adds an outline around the entire image. This helps you see where the edges of the head are.

7. Setting Up the Camera View
The script sets up how you'll view this 3D model:
- It positions a virtual camera to look at the head from a specific angle.
- Adjusts the zoom level so everything fits nicely on your screen.

8. Displaying Everything
Finally, it puts all these pieces together in the window and displays them:
- The skin surface, bone surface, and outline are shown in their respective colors.
- You can see this image on your computer screen.

How It Works Together

1. Load Image: The script starts by loading a 3D image of a head.
2. Find Skin & Bones: It then looks for specific points within the image that represent skin and bones, creating separate surfaces for each.
3. Color & Display: These surfaces are colored differently so you can tell them apart, and everything is displayed in a window on your screen.

Why This Is Useful

This script helps doctors or researchers visualize what's inside a person's head without having to do surgery. By seeing the skin and bones separately, they can better understand the structure and maybe even spot issues that need attention.

In simple terms, this script takes a complex 3D image and makes it easier to see and understand by breaking it down into simpler parts (skin and bone) and displaying them clearly on your screen.
