Purpose
This script is designed to show how high-frequency details can get lost or distorted when we reduce the resolution of an image. It demonstrates this using two different methods on a 3D image of a skull.

Step-by-Step Explanation

1. Setting Up:
   - The script starts by importing some tools and libraries that help with handling images, colors, and rendering (displaying) them on screen.

2. Reading the Image:
   - It reads an image file named 'IsoSubsample_FullHead.mhd'. This is like opening a picture of a skull in 3D.

3. Creating Two Processing Pipelines:
   - The script sets up two different ways to process this image, which we'll call "smoothed" and "unsmoothed".

4. Smoothed Pipeline:
   - First, it applies a smoothing filter to the image. This is like blurring the picture slightly to reduce sharp details.
   - Then, it reduces the resolution of the smoothed image by 4 times in two dimensions (like making the picture smaller).
   - Next, it creates an "isosurface" from this smoothed and reduced image. An isosurface is a 3D shape that represents a specific value within the volume data.
   - Finally, it sets up how to display this processed image on screen.

5. Unsmoothed Pipeline:
   - It directly reduces the resolution of the original image by 4 times in two dimensions (without smoothing).
   - Then, it creates an isosurface from this unsmoothed and reduced image.
   - Finally, it sets up how to display this processed image on screen.

6. Setting Up the Display:
   - The script prepares a window that will show both images side by side.
   - It sets up two separate viewing areas (like dividing a TV screen into left and right halves).
   - Each area is assigned one of the processed images: the unsmoothed image on the left, and the smoothed image on the right.

7. Configuring the View:
   - It adjusts the camera angles for both views to make sure we see the 3D shapes properly.
   - It sets different background colors for each viewing area so they're easy to tell apart.
   - Finally, it sizes the window and gives it a title: "IsoSubsample".

8. Displaying Everything:
   - The script opens up a window showing both images side by side.
   - You can interact with this window using your mouse or keyboard.

What It Shows
When you run this script, you'll see two 3D skull images side by side:
- On the left: A version that was reduced in resolution without smoothing first. This might look distorted because high-frequency details (sharp edges) got mixed up.
- On the right: A version that was smoothed before reducing its resolution. This looks cleaner and less distorted.

Why It's Useful
This script helps visualize what happens when you reduce the resolution of detailed images. It shows why it's important to smooth or filter high-frequency details first, otherwise, you get artifacts (unwanted distortions) in your final image.
