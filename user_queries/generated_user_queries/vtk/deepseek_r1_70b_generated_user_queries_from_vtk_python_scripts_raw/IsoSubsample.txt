Okay, so I need to describe this Python script step by step. The user wants a clear, human-written explanation without any code or comments. They specified including exact library names, file paths, variables, and breaking down each part.

First, I'll look at the imports. The script uses several vtkmodules libraries: vtkInteractionStyle, vtkRenderingOpenGL2, vtkNamedColors, vtkImageMarchingCubes, vtkIOImage, vtkImagingCore, vtkImagingGeneral, and vtkRenderingCore. I should list these exactly as they are.

Next, the main function starts by initializing colors with vtkNamedColors(). Then it sets file_name to 'IsoSubsample_FullHead.mhd'. That's an important file path to note.

The script reads the image using vtkImageReader2Factory(), creating a reader object. It sets the filename and updates the reader. I'll need to explain each of these steps clearly.

Then there are two pipelines: smoothed and unsmoothed. For the smoothed pipeline, it applies a Gaussian smooth filter with specific parameters. After smoothing, it subsamples using vtkImageShrink3D() with factors (4,4,1). It then uses ImageMarchingCubes to create an isosurface at value 1150.

The mapper and actor for this pipeline are set up, turning off scalar visibility and setting the color to Ivory. I'll make sure to mention each variable like iso_smoothed_actor.

For the unsmoothed pipeline, it directly subsamples the reader output with the same shrink factors. Then it creates another isosurface, sets up its mapper and actor similarly, also colored Ivory.

The rendering part involves creating two renderers, setting their viewports to left and right. The main window adds both renderers. An interactor is set up for user interaction.

Actors are added to each renderer: iso_actor on the left and iso_smoothed_actor on the right. Cameras are configured with specific focal points, positions, and views. Background colors are set to SlateGray and LightSlateGray.

Finally, the window size is set to 640x480, named 'IsoSubsample', rendered, and the interactor starts.

I need to structure all this into a step-by-step explanation without using any markdown or code. Each part should be clearly described so someone can reproduce it.

1. **Import Libraries**:  
   - `vtkmodules.vtkInteractionStyle`  
   - `vtkmodules.vtkRenderingOpenGL2`  
   - `vtkNamedColors` from `vtkmodules.vtkCommonColor`  
   - `vtkImageMarchingCubes` from `vtkmodules.vtkFiltersGeneral`  
   - `vtkImageReader2Factory` from `vtkmodules.vtkIOImage`  
   - `vtkImageShrink3D` from `vtkmodules.vtkImagingCore`  
   - `vtkImageGaussianSmooth` from `vtkmodules.vtkImagingGeneral`  
   - `vtkActor`, `vtkPolyDataMapper`, `vtkRenderWindow`, `vtkRenderWindowInteractor`, and `vtkRenderer` from `vtkmodules.vtkRenderingCore`.

2. **Define Variables**:  
   - `colors`: An instance of `vtkNamedColors`.  
   - `file_name`: Set to `'IsoSubsample_FullHead.mhd'`.

3. **Read the Image**:  
   - Create a reader factory using `vtkImageReader2Factory()`.  
   - Create a reader object and set its file name to `file_name`.  
   - Update the reader to load the image.

4. **Smoothed Pipeline**:  
   - Apply Gaussian smoothing:  
     - Create a smoother (`smooth`) with `vtkImageGaussianSmooth()`.  
     - Set dimensionality to 3.  
     - Connect input to the reader's output.  
     - Set standard deviations (1.75, 1.75, 0.0) and radius factor (2).  

   - Subsample the smoothed image:  
     - Create a shrinker (`subsample_smoothed`) with `vtkImageShrink3D()`.  
     - Connect input to the smoother's output.  
     - Set shrink factors (4, 4, 1).  

   - Generate isosurface from smoothed data:  
     - Create marching cubes (`iso_smoothed`) with `vtkImageMarchingCubes()`.  
     - Connect input to the smoother’s output.  
     - Set contour value to 1150.

5. **Unsmoothed Pipeline**:  
   - Subsample the original image:  
     - Create a shrinker (`subsample`) with `vtkImageShrink3D()`.  
     - Connect input to the reader's output.  
     - Set shrink factors (4, 4, 1).  

   - Generate isosurface from subsampled data:  
     - Create marching cubes (`iso`) with `vtkImageMarchingCubes()`.  
     - Connect input to the shrinker’s output.  
     - Set contour value to 1150.

6. **Create Mappers and Actors**:  
   - For smoothed pipeline:  
     - Create mapper (`iso_smoothed_mapper`) and connect it to `iso_smoothed`’s output.  
     - Disable scalar visibility.  
     - Create actor (`iso_smoothed_actor`), set its mapper, and color to "Ivory".  

   - For unsmoothed pipeline:  
     - Create mapper (`iso_mapper`) and connect it to `iso`’s output.  
     - Disable scalar visibility.  
     - Create actor (`iso_actor`), set its mapper, and color to "Ivory".

7. **Set Up Rendering Pipeline**:  
   - Define viewports:  
     - Left viewport: `[0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 1.0]`.  
     - Right viewport: `[0.5, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0]`.  

   - Create two renderers (`renderer_left` and `renderer_right`) and set their viewports.  

   - Create a render window (`render_window`) and add both renderers.  

   - Create an interactor (`render_window_interactor`) and connect it to the render window.

8. **Add Actors to Renderers**:  
   - Add `iso_actor` to `renderer_left`.  
   - Add `iso_smoothed_actor` to `renderer_right`.

9. **Configure Cameras and Appearance**:  
   - Set left renderer’s camera:  
     - Focal point at `(0.0, 0.0, 0.0)`.  
     - Position at `(0.0, -1.0, 0.0)`.  
     - View up direction `(0.0, 0.0, -1.0)`.  
     - Reset camera and adjust azimuth (-20°) and elevation (20°).  

   - Set background colors:  
     - Left renderer: "SlateGray".  
     - Right renderer: "LightSlateGray".  

   - Synchronize the right renderer’s camera with the left renderer’s active camera.

10. **Finalize and Display**:  
    - Set render window size to 640x480 pixels.  
    - Set window title to `'IsoSubsample'`.  
    - Render the scene and start the interactor.
