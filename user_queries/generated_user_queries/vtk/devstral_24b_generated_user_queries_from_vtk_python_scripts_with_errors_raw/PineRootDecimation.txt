Sure, let's break down this Python script step by step in simple language:

### Purpose
This script is designed to clean up and reduce the size of 3D data representing a pine root. It removes noisy parts (unwanted details) and makes the data smaller so it can be handled more easily.

### Step-by-Step Explanation

1. Importing Tools:
   - The script starts by importing various tools that will help in processing the 3D data. These are like different specialized instruments you might use for a specific job.

2. Defining a Helper Function:
   - It defines a helper function called `NumberOfTriangles` which counts how many triangles make up the 3D shape. Think of it as counting all the small flat surfaces that together form the 3D model.

3. Setting Up Colors:
   - The script sets up some colors to be used later for displaying the 3D data on screen.

4. Reading the Data File:
   - It reads a file named 'PineRootDecimation_pine_root.tri' which contains the 3D data of the pine root.
   - After reading, it prints out how many triangles are in the original data before any processing.

5. Reducing the Size (Decimation):
   - The script applies a tool called `vtkDecimatePro` to reduce the number of triangles in the model. This is like simplifying a complex drawing by removing some details while keeping the overall shape.
   - It sets various parameters for how much reduction should happen and updates the data.

6. Counting Triangles After Reduction:
   - It counts the number of triangles again after the size reduction and prints this number to show how much smaller the model has become.

7. Removing Noise (Connectivity Filter):
   - Next, it uses another tool called `vtkConnectivityFilter` to remove any disconnected or noisy parts from the 3D data.
   - This is like cleaning up a messy drawing by removing stray lines that don't belong to the main shape.

8. Counting Triangles After Cleanup:
   - It counts the triangles one more time after this cleanup step and prints out the number.

9. Preparing for Display:
   - The script sets up how the 3D model will be displayed on screen.
   - It creates a mapper to translate the data into something that can be drawn, and an actor to represent the 3D object in the scene.
   - It also adds an outline around the data for better context.

10. Setting Up the View:
    - The script sets up a window where the 3D model will be displayed.
    - It configures the camera position and angle so that the pine root is shown clearly when viewed.

11. Rendering the Image:
    - Finally, it renders (draws) the image on screen and starts an interactive session where you can view and interact with the 3D model of the pine root.

### Summary
In simple terms, this script takes a complex 3D model of a pine root, cleans up any noisy or unnecessary parts, reduces its size to make it easier to handle, and then displays it on screen in an interactive window. It's like taking a detailed sculpture, simplifying it while keeping the important features, and then showing it off in a nice display case where you can look at it from different angles.
