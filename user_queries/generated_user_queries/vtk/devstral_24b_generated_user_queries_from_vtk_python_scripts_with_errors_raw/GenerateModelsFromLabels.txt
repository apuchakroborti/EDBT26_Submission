Sure, let's break down this Python script step by step in simple language:

### What This Script Does
This script takes a 3D image file (like a medical scan) that contains different labeled areas and creates separate models for each label. Think of it like taking a colored map where each color represents something different (like different tissues in a body scan), and then creating individual 3D shapes for each color.

### Step-by-Step Explanation

#### 1. Setting Up the Tools
The script starts by importing some tools (modules) that will help it read, process, and write files. These are like specialized instruments in a workshop.

#### 2. Checking VTK Version
It checks if a specific tool called "vtkDiscreteFlyingEdges3D" is available. This tool helps create the 3D shapes from the labels. If this tool isn't available, it uses an older version of the tool instead.

#### 3. Setting Up Variables
The script sets up some basic information:
- The name of the file to read (`GenerateModelsFromLabels_frogtissue.mhd`)
- The range of label numbers to process (from 1 to 29)
- Some settings for how smooth the shapes should be

#### 4. Creating Objects
It creates several objects that will help with different parts of the task:
- A reader to read the file
- A histogram maker to count how many times each label appears
- A shape creator (either `vtkDiscreteFlyingEdges3D` or `vtkDiscreteMarchingCubes`)
- A smoother to make the shapes look nicer
- A selector to pick out specific labels
- A cleaner to remove unnecessary data
- A geometry filter to prepare the shapes for output
- A writer to save the shapes as files

#### 5. Reading the File
The script tells the reader object to open and read the file specified.

#### 6. Making a Histogram
It uses the histogram maker to count how many times each label appears in the file. This helps it know which labels are actually present.

#### 7. Creating Shapes
For each label (from 1 to 29), it:
- Creates a shape for that label using the shape creator.
- Smooths out the shape to make it look better.
- Selects only the cells (parts) of the shape that match the current label.

#### 8. Cleaning Up
It removes any extra data from the shapes so they're clean and ready to be saved.

#### 9. Writing Files
For each shape, it:
- Creates a file name based on the label number.
- Tells the writer object to save the shape as a new file.

### Summary
In simple terms, this script reads a 3D image with different labeled areas, creates individual 3D shapes for each label, smooths them out, and saves each shape as a separate file. It's like taking a multi-colored cake and cutting it into pieces, smoothing the edges, and then wrapping each piece in its own box.

This process helps people who need to analyze these 3D images (like doctors looking at medical scans) by giving them clean, individual models of different parts of the image.
