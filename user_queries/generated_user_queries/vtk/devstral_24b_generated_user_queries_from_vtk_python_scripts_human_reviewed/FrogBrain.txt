A Python script is designed to visualize 3D models of frog tissues using VTK (Visualization Toolkit), with a specific focus on comparing smoothed versus non-smoothed representations of these tissues.

### Overall Purpose and Functionality
The primary purpose of this script is to:
1. Load a 3D image dataset representing different frog tissues.
2. Extract and visualize specific tissue structures in two forms: one without smoothing (left side) and one with smoothing applied (right side).
3. Display the results using VTK's rendering capabilities.

### Major Components

#### Modules Used
- Pathlib: For handling file paths.
- VTK Modules:
  - `vtkInteractionStyle`, `vtkRenderingOpenGL2`: For rendering and interaction.
  - `vtkNamedColors` from `vtkmodules.vtkCommonColor`, `vtkLookupTable`, `vtkVersion`: For color management and version checking.
  - Various VTK classes for image processing, surface extraction, smoothing, and visualization.
  - VTK_VERSION_NUMBER, vtkLookupTable, vtkVersion vtkmodules.vtkCommonCore
  - vtkFlyingEdges3D, vtkMarchingCubes, vtkPolyDataNormals, vtkStripper, and vtkWindowedSincPolyDataFilter from vtkmodules.vtkFiltersCore 
  - vtkMetaImageReader from vtkmodules.vtkIOImage
  - vtkImageThreshold from vtkmodules.vtkImagingCore
  - vtkImageGaussianSmooth from vtkmodules.vtkImagingGeneral 
  - vtkActor, vtkPolyDataMapper, vtkRenderWindow, vtkRenderWindowInteractor, vtkRenderer from vtkmodules.vtkRenderingCore
   

#### Functions
1. main(data_folder, tissue):
   - Sets up the rendering environment.
   - Creates actors (3D objects) for both smoothed and non-smoothed tissues.
   - Configures camera settings and background colors.
   - Initiates the rendering process.
   - Should read a `.mhd` file named `FrogBrain_frogtissue.mhd`

2. create_smooth_frog_actor(file_name, tissue, use_flying_edges):
   - Reads the 3D image data.
   - Selects specific tissue values using thresholding.
   - Applies Gaussian smoothing to the selected tissue.
   - Extracts isosurfaces and applies additional smoothing.
   - Creates a VTK actor for rendering.

3. create_frog_actor(file_name, tissue, use_flying_edges):
   - Similar to `create_smooth_frog_actor` but without applying Gaussian smoothing or additional smoothing filters.

4. create_frog_lut(colors):
   - Creates a lookup table (LUT) for mapping tissue types to colors in the visualization.

5. create_tissue_map():
   - Defines a dictionary that maps tissue names to their corresponding integer values used in the dataset.

6. vtk_version_ok(major, minor, build):
   - Checks if the installed VTK version meets or exceeds a specified version number.

### Workflow

1. Initialization and Input Handling:
   - The script starts by defining default parameters for `data_folder` and `tissue`.
   - It then calls the `main()` function with these parameters.

2. Rendering Setup in main():
   - Creates actors for both smoothed and non-smoothed tissue representations.
   - Configures camera settings to provide a consistent view of both models.
   - Sets background colors and window properties.
   - Initiates rendering using VTK's interactor.

3. Actor Creation:
   - `create_smooth_frog_actor()`:
     - Reads the image data.
     - Applies thresholding to isolate specific tissue values.
     - Smooths the selected tissue using Gaussian smoothing and additional polydata filtering.
     - Creates an isosurface and applies further smoothing if needed.
     - Returns a VTK actor for rendering.

   - `create_frog_actor()`:
     - Similar process but without applying Gaussian or additional smoothing filters.

4. Color Mapping:
   - `create_frog_lut(colors)`: Defines colors for different tissue types using a lookup table.

5. Tissue Mapping:
   - `create_tissue_map()`: Maps human-readable tissue names to integer values used in the dataset.

6. Version Checking:
   - `vtk_version_ok(major, minor, build)`: Ensures compatibility with required VTK version features.

### Key Features

- Dual Visualization: The script provides a side-by-side comparison of smoothed and non-smoothed tissue models.
- VTK Compatibility: Includes checks to ensure the correct VTK version is used.
- Modular Design: Functions are well-defined for specific tasks, making the code easier to maintain and extend.

### Conclusion
This script leverages VTK's powerful visualization capabilities to create detailed 3D renderings of frog tissues. It provides a clear comparison between smoothed and non-smoothed models, which can be useful for scientific visualization or educational purposes. The modular design ensures that each component of the process is clearly defined and easily modifiable.
