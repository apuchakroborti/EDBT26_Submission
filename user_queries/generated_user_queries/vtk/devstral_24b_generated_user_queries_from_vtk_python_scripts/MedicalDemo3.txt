This script is a Python implementation of a 3D medical visualization using the Visualization Toolkit (VTK). Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Imports and Initial Setup**:
   - Import necessary VTK modules.
   - Define the `vtk_version_ok` function to check if the required VTK version is available.

2. **Main Function (`main()`)**:
   - Create a renderer, render window, and interactor for rendering the scene.
   - Set up colors using `vtkNamedColors`.
   - Read the medical data from a file (assumed to be in the same directory as the script).

3. **Skin Extraction**:
   - Use an isosurface filter (`vtkMarchingCubes` or `vtkFlyingEdges3D`) to extract skin surfaces at a specific contour value.
   - Apply a stripper and mapper to prepare the data for rendering.
   - Create an actor for the skin with specified properties (color, opacity).

4. **Bone Extraction**:
   - Similar process as skin extraction but for bone surfaces at a different contour value.

5. **Outline Creation**:
   - Create an outline around the data using `vtkOutlineFilter`.

6. **Orthogonal Planes**:
   - Create three orthogonal planes (sagittal, axial, coronal) with different color mappings.
   - Use `vtkImageMapToColors` to apply lookup tables for coloring.

7. **Camera Setup**:
   - Set up the camera position and orientation.
   - Add actors (skin, bone, outline, planes) to the renderer.
   - Adjust visibility and opacity settings.

8. **Rendering**:
   - Render the scene and start the interactor for user interaction.

9. **Version Check Function (`vtk_version_ok`)**:
   - Compare the required VTK version with the installed version.

10. **Execution**:
    - Call `main()` if the script is run as the main module.

This script provides a comprehensive example of how to use VTK for medical data visualization, including handling different contour values, creating orthogonal planes, and setting up camera views.
