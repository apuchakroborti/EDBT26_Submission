### Step-by-Step Description of the Python Script

1. Import Libraries:
   - Import `vtkInteractionStyle` from `vtkmodules`.
   - Import `vtkRenderingOpenGL2` from `vtkmodules`.
   - Import `vtkNamedColors` from `vtkCommonColor`.
   - Import `vtkClipPolyData` from `vtkFiltersCore`.
   - Import `vtkImageDataGeometryFilter` from `vtkFiltersGeometry`.
   - Import `vtkPNMReader` from `vtkIOImage`.
   - Import `vtkImageGaussianSmooth` from `vtkImagingGeneral`.
   - Import the following from `vtkRenderingCore`: `vtkActor`, `vtkPolyDataMapper`, `vtkRenderWindow`, `vtkRenderWindowInteractor`, and `vtkRenderer`.
   - From `vtkmodules.vtkIOImage`, import `vtkPNGWriter`
   - From `vtkmodules.vtkRenderingCore`, import `vtkWindowToImageFilter`

2. Define Variables:
   - Set `fileName` to `'CreateBFont_B.pgm'`.

3. Initialize Rendering Components:
   - Create a renderer (`ren1`).
   - Create a render window (`renWin`) and add the renderer to it.
   - Create a render window interactor (`iren`) and link it to the render window.

4. Read Image Data:
   - Use `vtkPNMReader` to read the image file specified by `fileName`.

5. Apply Gaussian Filter:
   - Apply a Gaussian smooth filter using `vtkImageGaussianSmooth`.
   - Set standard deviations, dimensionality, and radius factors.
   - Connect the filter to the image reader's output.

6. Extract Geometry:
   - Use `vtkImageDataGeometryFilter` to extract geometry from the filtered image data.

7. Clip Poly Data:
   - Clip the poly data using `vtkClipPolyData`.
   - Set the clip value, disable scalar generation, enable inside-out clipping, and update the output.

8. Create Mapper and Actor:
   - Create a mapper (`vtkPolyDataMapper`) connected to the clipped data.
   - Disable scalar visibility on the mapper.
   - Create an actor (`letter`) using the mapper.

9. Configure Actor Properties:
   - Add the actor to the renderer.
   - Set the actor's diffuse color to "LampBlack" and representation to wireframe.

10. Set Renderer Background and Camera:
    - Set the background color of the renderer to "WhiteSmoke".
    - Reset the camera, dolly in by 1.2 times, and reset the clipping range.

11. Configure Render Window:
    - Set the render window size to 640x480 pixels.
    - Set the window title to 'CreateBFont'.

12. Render and Interact:
    - Render the scene.
    - Start the interaction with the render window interactor.

13. Save the rendered window as a PNG file:
   - The code captures the current visual contents of a VTK render window by using `vtkWindowToImageFilter`, 
      a specialized filter that takes the active render window as input and converts its contents into an image format. 
      This filter is then updated to process the render window's image data and prepare it for output. 
      To save the captured image, `vtkPNGWriter` is used—an image writer that writes the processed image data to disk in PNG format. 
      The writer is configured with a desired filename (e.g., "CreateBFont_output.png") and connected to the output of the image filter. 
      Finally, the writer executes the saving process, writing the render window’s image to a PNG file.
