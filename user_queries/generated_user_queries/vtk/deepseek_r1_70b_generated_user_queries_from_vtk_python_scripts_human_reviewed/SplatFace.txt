### Step-by-Step Description of the Python Script

1. Import Required Libraries:
   - Import `vtkmodules.vtkInteractionStyle`
   - Import `vtkmodules.vtkRenderingOpenGL2`
   - Import `vtkNamedColors` from `vtkmodules.vtkCommonColor`
   - Import `vtkContourFilter`, `vtkMaskPoints`, and `vtkPolyDataNormals` from `vtkmodules.vtkFiltersCore`
   - Import `vtkPolyDataReader` from `vtkmodules.vtkIOLegacy`
   - Import `vtkGaussianSplatter` from `vtkmodules.vtkImagingHybrid`
   - Import `vtkActor`, `vtkCamera`, `vtkPolyDataMapper`, `vtkRenderWindow`, `vtkRenderWindowInteractor`, and `vtkRenderer` from `vtkmodules.vtkRenderingCore`
   - From `vtkmodules.vtkIOImage`, import `vtkPNGWriter`
   - From `vtkmodules.vtkRenderingCore`, import `vtkWindowToImageFilter`

2. Define the Main Function:
   - Initialize `colors` using `vtkNamedColors()` for color management.
   - Set `fileName` to `'SplatFace_fran_cut.vtk'`.

3. Create Rendering Objects:
   - Create a renderer (`ren1`), render window (`renWin`), and render window interactor (`iren`).
   - Add the renderer to the render window and set the interactor's render window.

4. Read Input File:
   - Use `vtkPolyDataReader` to read the file specified by `fileName`.

5. Process Data with Filters:
   - Apply `vtkPolyDataNormals` to compute normals from the reader output.
   - Use `vtkMaskPoints` to reduce the number of points, setting the ratio to 8.
   - Apply `vtkGaussianSplatter` to create a volume from the masked points:
     - Set sample dimensions to (100, 100, 100)
     - Set eccentricity to 2.5
     - Enable normal warping
     - Set scale factor to 1.0 and radius to 0.025

6. Extract Contours:
   - Use `vtkContourFilter` on the splattered data, setting the contour value to 0.25.

7. Create Mappers and Actors:
   - Create a mapper (`splatMapper`) for the contour output and disable scalar visibility.
   - Create an actor (`splatActor`) for the splat data, setting its color to 'Flesh'.
   - Create another mapper (`cyberMapper`) for the original reader output and disable scalar visibility.
   - Create an actor (`cyberActor`) for the cyberware data, setting it to wireframe representation with 'Turquoise' color.

8. Configure Renderer:
   - Add both actors to the renderer.
   - Set the background color to 'Wheat'.
   - Set the render window size to 640x480 and title to 'SplatFace'.

9. Set Up Camera:
   - Create a camera with specific clipping range, focal point, position, view angle, and up vector.

10. Render and Interact:
    - Render the scene.
    - Start the interactor to handle user interactions.

11. Save the rendered window as a PNG file:
   - The code captures the current visual contents of a VTK render window by using `vtkWindowToImageFilter`, 
      a specialized filter that takes the active render window as input and converts its contents into an image format. 
      This filter is then updated to process the render window's image data and prepare it for output. 
      To save the captured image, `vtkPNGWriter` is used—an image writer that writes the processed image data to disk in PNG format. 
      The writer is configured with a desired filename (e.g., "SplatFace_output.png") and connected to the output of the image filter. 
      Finally, the writer executes the saving process, writing the render window’s image to a PNG file.

12. Run Main Function:
    - Execute `main()` when the script is run as the main program.
