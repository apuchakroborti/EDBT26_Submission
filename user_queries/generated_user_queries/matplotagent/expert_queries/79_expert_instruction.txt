I have a h5 data of iris flower named "79_h5_data.h5". The list of datasets is ['Petal Length(cm)', 'Petal Width(cm)', 'Sepal Length(cm)', 'Sepal Width(cm)', 'Species'].
Write a python code to draw a plot.
1. Create a 3D scatter plot with axes representing 'Petal Length', 'Petal-Width', and 'Sepal Length'.
2. Plot data points for each iris flower species using distinct colors.
3. For each species, calculate the mean of the data points to determine the ellipsoid center.
4. Compute the covariance matrix for each species to define the ellipsoid shape and orientation.
5. Scale the ellipsoids to include 95% of the respective data points, ensuring they are aligned with the dataset's principal variation axes.
6. Draw solid, opaque ellipsoids for each species in matching colors to the scatter points, without wireframes.
7. Add axis labels for each measurement dimension and a legend that identifies each species by color.
