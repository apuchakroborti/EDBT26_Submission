I want a polar coordinate diagram to visualize the highest temperature data in Amherst on the first of each month, spanning from January 1, 2004, to August 1, 2015. The data is named "95_h5_data.h5". 
The data contains three datasets: `Year`, `Date`, and `Temperature` 
Here are My specific requirements for the visualization:
- The diagram should be divided into 12 sectors, corresponding to the months of the year.
- Temperature data should be plotted on the diagram according to the month.
- The points representing the temperature data should be circular.
- These points should be slightly offset so as not to align on a single radial line, with each point for the 1st of a month positioned between that month and the next. The offset should range from 0 to π/6 radians.
- Month labels should be abbreviated (Jan, Feb, Mar, etc.) instead of numerical (1, 2, 3, etc.).
- A blue curve should connect the data points for the year 2015 to distinguish it from other years.
- The legend should be moved to the right to avoid overlapping the diagram.
The diagram will serve as a clear visual representation of temperature trends and variations by month over several years, with particular emphasis on the data from 2015.
