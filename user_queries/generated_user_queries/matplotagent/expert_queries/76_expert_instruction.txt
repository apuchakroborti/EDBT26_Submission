I Have some data of Clothing Stores Retail Sales in U.S.A named in h5 format named '76_h5_data.h5'. 
There are two datasets in the .h5 file. The first dataset is "Womans Millions of dollars". the second dataset is "Mens millions of Dollars". 
Write a python script to read data from file "76_h5_data.h5" and create a vertical two-part graph with the top part being a box plot and the bottom part a histogram. 
The data visualized relates to 'Womens millions of dollars' in retail sales. The plot showcase the distribution of women's clothing retail sales in the U.S. 
The upper section is an axis-free box plot highlighting key statistical values, while the lower section is a histogram detailing the frequency distribution. 
Red dashed lines indicate the quartiles, seamlessly connecting both plots to emphasize these measures.The box plot should have no visible axes, and it should be narrower in width. 
Include numerical labels for key statistics such as the minimum, lower quartile, median, upper quartile, and maximum values, placed just above the box plot. 
The histogram should have visible axes and a smaller bin size for finer details. Add two continuous red dashed lines at the lower and upper quartiles. 
These lines should extend seamlessly across both the box plot and the histogram, without any gaps. 
The entire plot should be tightly laid out with no space between the box plot and the histogram so that the line can have no break.
