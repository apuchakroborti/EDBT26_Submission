Write a Python code to create a combination chart from a dataset named "96_h5_data.h5". 
The dataset contains sales data for various mobile phone brands (`Samsung`, `Nokia/Microsoft`, `Apple`, `LG`, `ZTE`, and `Huawei`) 
across different quarters of the year titled "Quarter" (e.g., "Q1 '10" for the first quarter of 2010). 
The dataset of the h5 file is ["Quarter", "Samsung", "Nokia/Microsoft", "Apple", "LG", "ZTE", "Huawei"]. 
The chart should include a box plot for each brand showing the distribution of sales data across quarters, with individual sales data points represented as dots. 
Also, calculate the overall mean sales for each brand and draw a line connecting these points. Ensure the line points align with their respective box plots. 
Use a consistent color scheme for the same quarter across different years, varying the shades to distinguish between years. 
Include a legend to aid in understanding the color coding. The box plot should be the underlying layer, and the data points should be on top, ensuring visibility.
