I want to plot a line graph of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) from October 2006 to August 2013.
The data is in '83_h5_data.h5'
The data contains three datasets:
    `date`: The date of the record.
    `Dow Jones Industrial Average`: The daily closing value of the DJIA.
    `1 year Moving Average`: The 1-year moving average value of the DJIA.
With this data, you can plot the line graph using Python. Here's how you can do it:

- Read the data from the h5 file using h5py.
- Convert the date datasets values to datetime for proper plotting.
- Plot the daily DJIA values and the 1-year moving average as lines on the graph.
- Fill the area between the lines with the appropriate colors using the fill_between method.
- Set the title of the graph and labels for the X and Y axes.
- Adjust the X-axis to display the dates in a readable format.
- Add a legend to the graph.
