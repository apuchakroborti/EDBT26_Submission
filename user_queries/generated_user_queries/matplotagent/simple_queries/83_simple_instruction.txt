I want to create a line chart of the Dow Jones Industrial Average from October 2006 to August 2013 using Python. The data is in '83_h5_data.h5' with dataset "Date", "Dow Jones Industrial Average" and "1 Year moving average". Write a Python code to read the data and draw two lines on the chart. You should also color the area between the lines based on certain rules. Then add a title, labels, and a legend, and make sure the dates are readable.
