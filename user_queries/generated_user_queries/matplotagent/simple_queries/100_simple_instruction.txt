Use a h5 file named "100_h5_data.h5" to create a polar plot visualizing electron transitions in an atom, with the plot representing only the top half of a circle (semi-circle). The file has datasets 'series', 'wavelength', 'L position', and 'p position'. The plot should represent only the top half of a circle (semi-circle) and include the following elements:
1. The semi-circle's radius should be divided into 6 concentric regions representing energy levels 1 to 6, with clear black lines separating them. Label the left side of the semi-circle with '1n' to '6n' indicators for each energy level, and the right side with corresponding energy values '0 eV' to '13.22 eV'.
2. Electron transitions, indicated by arrows within the semi-circle, should originate from the 'l position' (lower energy level) and point to the 'p position' (higher energy level). Arrows should be evenly spaced to avoid overlap, and each should be annotated with its transition wavelength at the head, just outside the semi-circle.
3. Color-code the transitions based on their series, like 'Lyman Series', 'Balmer Series', 'Paschen Series', etc., and use a lighter shade of the same color to highlight the angular range of each series.
4. Ensure the plot is clear and legible, with no overlapping text or arrows. Exclude radial gridlines, radial ticks, or angle labels.
5. Title the plot "Electron Transitions for an Atom".
The data should be sorted by the 'Series' dataset, and all labels and annotations should be easily readable. The plot should effectively represent the data in a visually appealing and scientifically accurate manner.
