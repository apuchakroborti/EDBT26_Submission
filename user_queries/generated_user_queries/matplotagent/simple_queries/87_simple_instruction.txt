Utilize the following datasets from '87_h5_data.h5' to create a sunburst plot:
- 'country': for the names of the countries,
- 'continent': to indicate which continent each country is in,
- 'lifeExp': showing the expected lifespan in each country,
- 'pop': representing the population of each country.
Your chart should:
- Organize the data hierarchically, starting with continents and then breaking down into countries.
- Use the population of each country to determine the size of its segment in the chart.
- Color code each segment by the country's expected lifespan, transitioning from red to blue across the range of values.
- Set the central value of the color scale to the average lifespan, weighted by the population of the countries.
- Finally, include a legend to help interpret the lifespan values as indicated by the color coding.
