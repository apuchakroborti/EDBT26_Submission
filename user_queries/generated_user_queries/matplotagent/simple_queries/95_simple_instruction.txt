Create a polar coordinate diagram using data from "95_h5_data.h5" to display the highest temperatures on the first of each month in Amherst, spanning from January 1, 2004, to August 1, 2015. The data includes datasets labeled "Year," "Date," and "Temperature." The diagram should include:

- 12 sectors, each representing a month of the year.
- Temperature data plotted according to the corresponding month.
- Circular points for the temperature data, slightly offset to prevent alignment along a single radial line.
- Abbreviated labels for the months (Jan, Feb, Mar, etc.).
- A blue curve that connects the data points from the year 2015.
- A legend positioned on the right side of the diagram.
- A title: "Monthly Highest Temperature in Amherst (2004-2015)."
The purpose of the diagram is to clearly illustrate the temperature trends and monthly variations over the years, with an emphasis on the data from 2015.
