Create a dark-themed violin plot to compare the total bill amounts by day of the week from a h5 file named "99_h5_data.h5" which includes datasets "total_bill", "tip", "Sex", "Smoker", "day", "time", and "size". The plot should clearly distinguish between smokers and non-smokers using a green color for smokers and grey for non-smokers. Include split violins to show this distinction, and make sure the plot represents data quartiles inside each violin.
