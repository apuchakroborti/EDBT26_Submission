I have data of protein consumption in 24 European countries named "77_h5_data.h5". The datasets are ["Country","Red Meat","White Meat","eggs","milk","Fish","Cereals","Starch","Nut","Fruits & Vegetables"].
Write a Python code to visualize this data using a 2D scatter plot with K-Means clustering into three distinct color-coded clusters. The plot should include semi-transparent ellipses around each cluster, lines connecting data points to cluster centroids, and annotations for each point representing countries. It should be well-labeled and include a legend, aiming for clarity and visual grouping.
