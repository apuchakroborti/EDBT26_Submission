I have data of iris flower named "79_h5_data.h5". Generate a 3D scatter plot from "79_h5_data.h5" using the datasets "Petal Length(cm)", "Petal width(cm)", "Sepal Length(cm)", and "Species". Use distinct colors to represent each iris flower species. For each species, include confidence ellipses that encompass 95% of the data points, ensuring these ellipses are aligned with the principal axes of variation in the dataset. The confidence ellipses should be solid, opaque, and color-matched to the scatter points of each species, without any wireframes. Ensure the plot includes labeled axes for 'Petal Length', 'Petal Width', and 'Sepal Length', and add a legend that clearly identifies each species by its corresponding color.
