Here is a reduced version of the text, keeping as many implementation details as possible and removing Python libraries:

**Reading HDF5 File**

I need to read an HDF5 file located at `/Users/apukumarchakroborti/gsu_research/llam_test/ACL_DIRS/ICESat_2/ATL02_20190520193327_08020311_006_01.h5`.

**Accessing Dataset**

The dataset I'm interested in is located at `/atlas/pce1/background/bg_cnt_50shot_s`. This dataset will be accessed and processed.

**Dataset Identification**

To identify the dataset within the HDF5 hierarchy, I need to keep track of its parent groups: `/`, `atlas`, `pce1`, and `background`.

**Displaying Data**

I'll display the data by creating a box plot. The x-axis label will be set to the descriptive name of the dataset.

Please note that this description is now in a more general format, without any specific programming details or Python libraries.
