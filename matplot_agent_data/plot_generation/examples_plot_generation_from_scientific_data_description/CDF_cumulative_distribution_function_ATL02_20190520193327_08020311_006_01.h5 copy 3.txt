Here's a reduced version of the description, keeping implementation details and removing Python libraries:

I'd like to analyze the distribution of values in an HDF5 file. The file is located at `/Users/apukumarchakroborti/gsu_research/llam_test/ACL_DIRS/ICESat_2/ATL02_20190520193327_08020311_006_01.h5`. 

I'd like to access a specific dataset named `/atlas/pce1/background/bg_cnt_50shot_s` within this file. The parent groups of this dataset are `/atlas`, `/pce1`, and `/background`. I want to extract the data from this dataset, print its shape, and identify its units and long name.

Next, I'd like to sort the extracted data in ascending order. Then, I'd like to create an array of cumulative probability values by dividing the sorted data indices by the total number of data points minus one. This will help me analyze the distribution of values in the dataset.

Finally, I'd like to plot the sorted data against the cumulative probability values using a CDF (cumulative distribution function). The x-axis label should be the long name attribute extracted earlier, and the y-axis label should be "Cumulative Probability".
