Here is a rewritten version of the description, reduced by 20% while keeping implementation details:

"I'd like to explain a Python code snippet that processes MRI brain image data. 

First, it loads data from an HDF5 file located at `FAST_MRI_BRAIN_H5_FILE`, specifically from the internal path `FAST_MRI_BRAIN_H5_FILE_DATA_PATH`. The data is then reshaped into a 3D array with shape `(16, 32, 512)`.

Next, two masks are created based on threshold values (`gm_min` and `gm_max`) applied to the brain volume. These masks are combined and refined to create a final mask.

The code visualizes this mask using a gray color map, displaying a slice of the mask.

Additionally, Gaussian smoothing is applied to the MRI brain volume with a kernel width of 2 standard deviations (`sigma=2`). This reduces noise in the image.

Finally, multiple slices of the smoothed volume are plotted using a grid of subplots, each displaying a slice with a gray color map. Overall, this code appears to be part of an MRI brain image processing pipeline."
