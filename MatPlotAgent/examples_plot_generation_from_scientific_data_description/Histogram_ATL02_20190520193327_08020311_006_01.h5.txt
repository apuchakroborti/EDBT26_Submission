**Extracting Data from HDF5 File**

I need to extract elevation data from an HDF5 file. Here's how I do it:

* Open the file `/Users/apukumarchakroborti/gsu_research/llam_test/ACL_DIRS/ICESat_2/ATL02_20190520193327_08020311_006_01.h5` in read-only mode.
* Access a dataset located at `/atlas/pce1/background/bg_cnt_50shot_s`.
* Extract elevation values, units, and long name from the dataset.

**Creating Histogram**

Next, I create a histogram of the elevation data:

* Use 20 bins and black edges for the histogram.
* Set x-axis label to `longname`, y-axis label to "Frequency", and title to "Distribution of "+`longname`.
* Display the plot.

Note: The file is automatically closed when the program finishes executing.
