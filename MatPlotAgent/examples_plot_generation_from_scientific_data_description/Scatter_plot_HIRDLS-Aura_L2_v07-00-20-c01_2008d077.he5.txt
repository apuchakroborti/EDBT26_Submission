Here's the reduced text, focusing on implementation details and keeping the names of parent groups for each dataset:

**Accessing HDF5 File**

Open an HDF5 file named "HIRDLS-Aura_L2_v07-00-20-c01_2008d077.he5" located at a specified directory path in read-only mode.

**Retrieving Datasets**

Extract three datasets from the "/HDFEOS/SWATHS/HIRDLS/Data Fields/" group:

1. "O3" dataset, which is assumed to be a single time-step.
2. "Pressure" dataset.
3. "Time" dataset.

**Reading Data and Attributes**

Read data from each dataset:

* First row of the "O3" dataset.
* All rows of the "Pressure" dataset.
* First 121 elements of the "Time" dataset.

Also, read attributes from each dataset:

* "Units" attribute from the "O3" dataset.
* "Title" attributes from the "O3", "Pressure", and "Time" datasets.

**Handling Fill Values**

Replace values matching the `_FillValue` attribute in the "O3" dataset with NaN (Not a Number).

**Printing Shapes**

Print the shapes of the "Pressure" and "Time" arrays.

**Creating a Scatter Plot**

Create a scatter plot using the extracted data:

* Label the x-axis as the title of the "Time" dataset.
* Label the y-axis as the title of the "Pressure" dataset.
* Combine the two titles for the plot's title.
* Display the plot.
